	Abstract = {Hybridization of intelligent systems is a promising research field concerned with the development of the next generation of intelligent systems. A fundamental stimulus to the investigations of Hybrid Intelligent Systems (HIS) is the awareness in the academic communities that combined approaches will be necessary if the remaining tough problems in artificial intelligence are to be solved. Recently, hybrid intelligent systems are getting popular due to their capabilities in handling several real world complexities involving imprecision, uncertainty and vagueness. Current research interests in this field focus on integration of the different computing paradigms like fuzzy logic, neurocomputation, evolutionary computation, probabilistic computing, intelligent agents, machine learning, other intelligent computing frameworks and so on. The phenomenal growth of hybrid intelligent systems and related topics has created the need for this International conference as a venue to present the latest research. HIS03 builds on the success of last year's. HIS02 was held in Santiago, Chile, 01--04, December 2002 and attracted participants from over 26 countries. HIS03, the Third International Conference on Hybrid Intelligent Systems, took place in Melbourne, Australia, December 14--17, 2003.},
