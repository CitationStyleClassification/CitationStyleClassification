  abstract = {We propose a novel scheme of Fuzzy Logic based dynamic routing in computer networks. The proposed dynamic routing algorithm is suited for application in Interior Gateway Protocols (IGP) inside an autonomous system (AS), such as a Local Area Networks (LAN). It is used in the protocols to find out a set of best possible routes, where each of the nodes broadcasts link status rather than broadcasting the whole routing table. The Self Adaptive Pareto Differential Evolution (SPDE) algorithm is little modified to apply it in solving efficient and optimal dynamic routing problem. One of the main features of the proposed routing scheme is that it outputs hierarchical quality solutions so that, if one path is blocked, there will be provisions of alternative paths for successful packet transmission in computer networks. The architecture of the proposed dynamic routing scheme is mainly composed of a controller, which makes use of a fuzzy-based decision making system. In a real world dynamic environment the controller finds out the optimal policy that determines weights on the parameters of routing. The total dynamic routing scheme is made to evolve intelligently in changing characteristics of daily network loads and usages. The proposed algorithm grains out the optimal routes for the packets to be transmitted. The paper also reviews the overall performance of the proposed routing scheme by applying it to a number of randomly generated real time computer networks. The fast response of our proposed scheme makes it suitable for real world applications like dynamic routing},

The hybrid PSO combines traditional velocity and position update rules of RANDIW-PSO and ideas from Self Adaptive Pareto Differential Evolution Algorithm (SPDE). The hybrid model is tested and compared with some high quality PSO models like the RANDIW-PSO and TVIW-PSO. The results indicate two good prospects of our proposed hybrid PSO model: potential to achieve faster convergence as well as potential to find a better solution. We obtain outstanding performance on solving single objective problems in comparison to several other PSO models. The hybrid PSO model, with the abovementioned features, is then efficiently used in the problem of coordinating a system of robot ants in order to help them to probe as much camera coverage area of some planetary surface or working field as possible, with minimum common area coverage. Thus by the Hybrid PSO, the total intersecting area of camera coverage regions of the robots is minimised quickly and efficiently, which is suited for online real world applications},

  abstract = {Of late, much progress has been made in developing Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDA), algorithms that use probabilistic modelling of high quality solutions to guide their search. While experimental results on EDA behaviour are widely available, theoretical results are still rare. This is especially the case for continuous EDA. We develop theory that predicts the effect of iterated density estimation and sampling used in the Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm in the continuous domain (UMDAc). We use truncation selection and monotonous fitness functions. Monotonous functions are commonly used to model the algorithm behaviour far from the optimum. Our result includes formulae to predict population statistics in a specific generation as well as population statistics after convergence. We find that population statistics develop identically for monotonous functions. We show that if assuming monotonous fitness functions, the distance that UMDAc travels across the search space is bounded and solely relies on the percentage of selected individuals and not on the structure of the fitness landscape. This can be problematic if this distance is too small for the algorithm to find the optimum. Also, by wrongly setting the selection intensity, one might not be able to explore the whole search space},

This algorithm was applied to a test network consisting of one bus depot, one school and ten bus stops with demand by commuting students. This school bus routing example is a multi-objective problem to minimise the number of operating buses and also the travel time of all buses, with bus capacity and time window constraints that are considered as penalty costs. Harmony Search could find good solution within the reasonable time with other advantages such as no derivative requirement and no initial value assumption. The presented routing model is expected to be applied to large-scale real networks in the future},

Molecular communication is designed using components existing in biological systems (e.g., receptors, nano-scale reactions, communication molecules) to enable communication at the molecular scale in an aqueous medium. We believe that with the advancement of bionanotechnology (as demonstrated by the work of Dr. Drew Endy, who gives a keynote speech at this year’s GECCO,) it may become possible to use components in biological systems to implement molecular communication systems.

The model uses two criteria for learning: tension and satisfaction. Tension is the inaccuracy of forecasting and this tension is minimised. Satisfaction is the mutual balance of coefficients used for this forecasting.
The model proceeds in an analogical way to living objects: it solves the tension moving according to the gradient of the satisfaction.
A living object, besides its movement as a whole on the gradient of satisfaction, is characterised by typical parts with a typical behaviour. The activity of these parts obeys some rules of consequences, for example: there first occurs a tension which is followed by a reaction in the muscular system which will change its form etc. If we are successful in locating these consequences in the economy it will be another brick in the wall that solidifies its definition as a living object. 
It seems that fixed capital formation corresponds to the muscular system and consumption of households is a candidate for the nervous system},

The optimisation goal is to minimise both the flight time and the consumed propellant mass of the trajectory created by the Q-law, and consequently to find Pareto-optimal trajectories. To improve the qualities of the obtained Pareto-optimal solutions, elitism and a diversity-preservation mechanism are incorporated into MOGA. The MOGA performance with and without the new mechanisms are systematically compared and evaluated with quantitative metrics. The new mechanisms significantly improve the convergence and distribution of the resulting Pareto front for the low-thrust orbit-transfer optimization problem.

In order to cope with the inherent video feed latency we propose an approach of anticipatory modelling in which the agent considers its current actions based on anticipated intrinsic (rather than currently available, outdated) state of the car and its surrounding. The driving style of the agent is first evolved offline on a software simulator of the car and then adapted online to the real world.  Experimental results demonstrate that on long runs the agent's-operated car is only marginally (about 5%) slower than a human-operated one, while the consistence of lap times posted by the evolved driving agent is better than that of a human.

A fully parallel version of RnaPredict using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) was implemented. The PRNG comparison tests were performed with known structures that are 118, 122, 543, and 556 nucleotides in length.

A key limitation of IEC is human fatigue. Based on the results of a study of a previous IEC MEMS tool, an alternate form that requires less human interaction is presented. The method is applied on top of a conventional multi-objective genetic algorithm, with the human in a supervisory role, providing evaluation only every nth-generation. Human interaction is applied to the evolution process by means of Pareto-rank shifting, which is used for the fitness calculation used in selection. Results of a test of 13 users shows that this IEC method can produce statistically significant better MEMS resonators than non-interactive evolutionary synthesis},

Oulipo is a French literary movement founded in the 1960s which applies mathematical constraints in the creation of literature making them distinct from other experimental literary groups [10]. Their literary creations change the dynamics of the author-reader relationship because they provide a different experience from reading traditional narratives where intuition and emergence are fundamental to creative exploration. We propose the application of the ACE methodology to arbitrate between a group of interacting authors to produce Oulipian literature and specifies experiment to test this approach in practice.

Unfortunately, for many different values of these parameters, the maximum number of codewords is currently unknown: instead we have a known upper bound and a known lower bound for this value. 

We investigate the use of different evolutionary algorithms for improving lower bounds for given parameters. We relate this problem to the well-known Maximum Clique Problem. We compare the performance of the evolutionary algorithms to Hill Climbing, Beam Search, Simulated Annealing, and greedy methods.

This paper presents a fuzzy-genetic approach that provides both path and trajectory planning, and has the advantage of considering diverse terrain conditions when determining the optimal path.  The terrain conditions are modelled using fuzzy linguistic variables to allow for the imprecision and uncertainty of the terrain data.  Although a number of methods have been proposed using GAs, few are appropriate for a dynamic environment or provide response in real-time.  The method proposed is robust, allowing the robot to adapt to dynamic conditions in the environment},

The large number of sampling locations, number of constituents to be monitored, and the frequency of the sampling make the LTM costly, especially since LTM may be required over several decades.  An optimisation algorithm based on the ant colony optimization (ACO) paradigm for solving the travelling salesman problem (TSP) is proposed to reduce the number of monitoring wells while minimising the overall data loss due to fewer sampling locations.  The ACO method is inspired by the ability of ant colony to identify the shortest route between their nest and a food source. Ants depositing pheromones along their paths act as a form of indirect communication.  The developed ACO-LTM algorithm is applied to a field site with an existing 30-well LTM network.   Optimal LTM networks with 27 to 21 wells, which represent a 10% to 30% reduction in sampling locations, resulted in overall data losses ranging from 0.383 to 1.74.  Results from developed ACO-LTM algorithm provide a proof-of-concept for the application of the general ACO analogy to the groundwater LTM sampling location optimisation problem},

We describe how to evolve a neural network control system for a mobile robot using a simulator applying concepts of multi-objective optimisation. Sometimes a single objective may not be adequate to describe the desired performance of the robot. In such cases, typecasting the problem as a multi-objective problem becomes necessary. We investigate the possibility of using evolutionary algorithms to evolve a controller for a mobile robot with multiple objectives to be satisfied simultaneously.  Such behavior includes obstacle avoidance, smooth motion and target acquisition. The novelty of this method lies in the evolution of different navigational behaviours simultaneously using concepts of Pareto-optimality and evolutionary algorithms. A neural network is used to provide the control structure for the navigation of the mobile robot. A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (FSGA) is used to identify the optimal neural network weights. The simulation results show that the proposed methodology is efficient and robust for evolving different behaviours simultaneously. Simulation results are provided and discussed},

We began by considering a hybrid  (i.e., particle swarm, genetic algorithm, hill climber) model to evolve the rules. We study hybrid heuristic models in the context of classification rule discovery. Nature inspired search algorithms such as Genetic Algorithms, Ant Colonies and Particle Swarm Optimization have been previously applied to data mining tasks, in particular, classification rule discovery. We extend this work by applying hybrid models that combine GA, PSO and/or hill climbers to the same type of classification tasks. Such models have already been tested and proved to be better than individual standalone search algorithms in various combinatorial optimisation problems. Our research focused on investigating the same kind of potential performance enhancements in classification rule discovery tasks.  We developed a model for a hybrid heuristic based classifier and implemented different variations of it in Java. These algorithms have been benchmarked against the well-known decision tree induction algorithm C4.5 using previously studied data sets in the literature. Results have been compared in terms of prediction accuracy, speed and comprehensibility. Our results showed that, heuristic based classifiers compete with C4.5 in terms of prediction accuracy on certain data sets and outperform C4.5 in general in terms of comprehensibility. C4.5 always outperformed heuristic based classifiers in terms of speed due to the relative inefficiency inherent in heuristic based classification models. We also showed that hybridisation of heuristics could bring improvements in terms of execution speed in comparison to plain standalone heuristic based classifiers.},

of different fields ranging from numerical optimisation to general creative
design.  However, to date, the question of why this success is possible has
never been adequately determined.  We examine two algorithms,
a genetic algorithm and a pseudo-exhaustive search algorithm dubbed Directed
Exhaustive Search.  We examine the GA\'s apparent ability to compound individual
mutations, and its role in the GA\'s optimisation.  We then explore the use
of the DES algorithm using a suitably altered mutation operator mimicking the
GA\'s surreptitious compounding of the mutation operator.  We find that the
DES algorithm is capable of performing comparably to or outperforming the GA 
over all test problems, as predicted by theory},

  abstract = {Neuroevolution is a promising learning method in tasks with
  extremely large state and action spaces and hidden states.  Recent
  advances allow neuroevolution to take place in real time, making it
  possible to e.g. construct video games with adaptive agents.  Often
  some of the desired behaviours for such agents are known, and it
  would make sense to prescribe them, rather than requiring evolution
  to discover them. We present a technique for incorporating
  human-generated advice in real time into neuroevolution. The advice
  is given in a formal language and converted to a neural network
  structure through KBANN. The NEAT neuroevolution method then
  incorporates the structure into existing networks through evolution
  of network weights and topology. The method is evaluated in the NERO
  video game, where it makes learning faster even when the tasks
  change and novel ways of making use of the advice are required. Such
  ability to incorporate human knowledge into neuroevolution in real
  time may prove useful in several interactive adaptive domains in the
  future},

We show that the way in which designs are genetically encoded influences which alternative structures are discovered, for problems in which a set of more than one optimal solution exists. The problem considered is one of the most ancient known to humanity: design a two-dimensional shape that, when rolled across flat ground, maintains a constant height. It was not until the late 19th century---roughly 7000 years after the discovery of the wheel---that Franz Reuleaux showed that a circle is not the only optimal solution. Here we demonstrate that artificial evolution repeats this discovery in under one hour},

We propose a new representation scheme based on prefix notation that overcomes the original GEP’s drawbacks. The resulted algorithm is called Prefix GEP (P-GEP). The major advantages with P-GEP include the natural hierarchy in forming the solutions and more protective genetic operations for substructure components. An artificial symbolic regression problem and a set of benchmark classification problems from UCI machine learning repository have been tested to demonstrate the applicability of P-GEP. The results show that P-GEP follows a faster fitness convergence curve and the rules generated from P-GEP consistently achieve better average classification accuracy compared with GEP},

Unfortunately, the search performance of small populations often reduces dramatically in a large search space. To address this problem, a method to find an optimal search dimension for small populations  is suggested. The basic idea is that the evolutionary algorithm starts with a small search dimension and then the search dimension is increased during the optimization. The search dimension will continue to increase if an increase in the search dimension improves the search performance. Otherwise, the search dimension will be decreased and then kept constant. Through empirical studies on a test problem with an infinite search dimension, we show that the proposed algorithm is able to find the search dimension that is the most efficient for the given population size.},
