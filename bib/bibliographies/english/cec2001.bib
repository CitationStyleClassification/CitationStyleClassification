  abstract = {The objective in this paper is to develop and
  implement FGP-2 (Financial Genetic Programming) on intra daily tick
  data for stock index options and futures arbitrage in a manner that
  is suitable for online trading when windows of profitable arbitrage
  opportunities exist for short periods from one to ten minutes.  Our
  benchmark for FGP-2 is the textbook rule for detecting arbitrage
  profits. This rule has the drawback that it awaits a contemporaneous
  profitable signal to implement an arbitrage in the same direction. A
  novel methodology of randomised sampling is used to train FGP-2 to
  pick up the fundamental arbitrage patterns. Care is taken to fine
  tune weights in the fitness function to enhance performance.  As
  arbitrage opportunities are few, missed opportunities can be as
  costly as wrong recommendations to trade. Unlike conventional
  genetic programs, FGP-2 has a constraint satisfaction feature
  supplementing the fitness function that enables the user to train
  the FGP to specify a minimum and a maximum number of profitable
  arbitrage opportunities that are being sought. Historical sample
  data on arbitrage opportunities enables the user to set these
  minimum and maximum bounds.  Good FGP rules for arbitrage are found
  to make a 3-fold improvement in profitability over the textbook
  rule. This application demonstrates the success of FGP-2 in its
  interactive capacity that allows experts to channel their knowledge
  into machine discovery },

Limiting size distribution: 0 for size < D, flat region size < 2D,
rapid falling size>=2D. Similar to subtree crossover.
Grow(unary) discrete gamma distribution (cf. Rowe01 ) cf subtree crossover.

Subtree crossover bloat (at least to 75 generations).
full no bloat, actually as with no fitness, "artifact of this particular problem".
