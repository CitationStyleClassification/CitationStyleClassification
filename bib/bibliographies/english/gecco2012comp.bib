 abstract = {While an increasing share of intermittent and non- dispatchable renewable energy plants cause probabilistic behavior at the power grids' supply side, the expected penetration of electric mobility at the demand side offers the opportunity of controllable load. Their optimal coordination is one major concern for future smart grids. Therefore, a multi-agent system will be proposed where each electric vehicle (agent) acts in response to dynamic conditions in its environment according to a given strategy. Optimizing these strategies will be the core of this paper, while evolutionary computation will be used for optimization. Here, simulation models will be applied for problem representation and solution evaluation. Thus, simulation allows modeling of complex as well as probabilistic systems, necessary for the herein tackled probem. In the end, the optimized strategies determine electric vehicles' charging behavior such that end-users' energy demand is satisfied and secure power grid operation is guaranteed throughout the considered grid using power from renewable plants. For solution representation, two different approaches will be compared concerning reachable solution quality as well as problem-specific metrics.},

This paper proposes and evaluates a new framework to operate a federation of IDCs in a green way. The proposed framework, called Green Monster, dynamically moves services (i.e., workload) across IDCs for increasing renewable energy consumption while maintaining their performance. It makes decisions of service migration and placement with an evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithm (EMOA) that evolves a set of solution candidates through global and local search processes. The proposed EMOA seeks the Pareto-optimal solutions by balancing the trade-offs among conflicting optimization objectives such as renewable energy consumption, cooling energy consumption and response time performance.},

This paper studies a relevant problem in VANETs, known as the deployment of RSUs. A RSU is an access points, used together with the vehicles, to allow information dissemination in the roads. Knowing where to place these RSUs so that a maximum number of vehicles circulating is covered is a challenge. We model the problem as a Maximum Coverage with Time Threshold Problem (MCTTP), and use a genetic algorithm to solve it. The algorithm is tested in four real-world datasets, and compared to a greedy approach previously proposed in the literature. The results show that our approach finds better results than the greedy in all scenarios, with gains up to 11 percentage points.},

 abstract = {Automatically configuring and dynamically controlling an Evolutionary Algorithm's (EA's) parameters is a complex task, yet doing so allows EAs to become more powerful and require less problem specific tuning to become effective. Supportive Coevolution is a new form of Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) that uses multiple populations to overcome the limitations of other automatic configuration techniques like self-adaptation, giving it the potential to concurrently evolve all of the parameters and operators in an EA. As a proof of concept experimentation comparing self-adaptation of n uncorrelated mutation step sizes with Supportive Coevolution for mutation step sizes was performed on the Rastrigin and Shifted Rastrigin benchmark functions. Statistical analysis showed Supportive Coevolution outperforming self-adaptation on all but one of the problem instances tested. Furthermore, analysis of instantaneous mutation success rate showed that this new technique is better able to adapt to the changes in the population fitness. Further study using multiple evolving parameters is needed to fully test Supportive Coevolution, but the results presented here show a promising outlook.},

We use two such problems, Order and Majority, to study autoconstructive evolution in the Push programming language.},

We will show how, beyond the usual measures employed in EA, specific measures such as the number of conflicts across clients can give us hints on the algorithm behavior, and how implementation details can change not only the running time, but also the behavior of the evolutionary algorithm itself. By using these measures we try to find ideal values for parameters such as the simultaneous number of individuals evaluated by a client or the way these are chosen from the pool.},

This library allows users either to apply these metaheuristics directly to their own fitness function or to extend it by implementing their own parallel optimization techniques. The library is written in CUDA-C to make extensive use of parallelization, as allowed by Graphics Processing Units.

After describing the library, we consider two practical case studies: the optimization of a fitness function for the automatic localization of anatomical brain structures in histological images, and the parallel implementation of Simulated Annealing as a new module, which extends the library while keeping code compatibility with it, so that the new method can be readily available for future use within the library as an alternative optimization technique.},

The benefits of a modular architecture, such as in the HeuristicLab optimization environment, will be examined under the light of a successful integration.

The concrete subject of the case study is a production scenario where different control strategies are used to plan different products. The question is whether machines should be dedicated to a certain control strategy or whether the machines should be shared. The quality is measured by the achieved service level and amounted inventory costs.},

 abstract = {Over the past few decades, evolutionary computation (EC) has grown substantially in use for biologists and engineers alike. Its transparency makes it an indispensable tool for studying evolutionary- and ecological dynamics, and it has provided researchers with new insights that would be tremendously difficult, if not impossible, to gain using natural systems. In addition, EC has proven to be a powerful search algorithm for engineering applications, and has produced numerous novel and human-competitive solutions to complex problems. Although several well-established packages are readily available, it seems that when most users harness the power of evolutionary computation, they do so using home-grown solutions. This can likely be attributed to the ease with which simple models are created, the user's need for customization, and the sizeable learning barrier imposed by available solutions, as well as difficulties in extending them.

We present SEEDS, a modular, open-source platform for conducting evolutionary computation experiments. SEEDS provides a simple, flexible, and extensible foundation that enables users with minimal programming experience to perform complex evolutionary and ecological simulations without having to first implement core functionality. In addition, SEEDS provides the tools necessary to make sharing data and reproducing experiments both easy and convenient.},

 abstract = {This paper describes the optimization knowledge base (OKB), a database for storing information about algorithms and problems. The optimization knowledge base allows to save results of algorithm executions as well as problem-specific information of fitness landscape analyses. This database can be queried and gives researchers a tool for gaining a better understanding of problems and algorithms and their behavior. Therefore the OKB supports parameter tuning and keeping track of tested algorithm and parameter settings as well as their results. Furthermore, the OKB and fitness landscape analysis can be used to not only explain the behavior of algorithms but to calculate similarities between problem instances and algorithms. Based on similarities and already captured knowledge, parameter settings can be extracted that could work well for new problem instances. Additionally, the OKB can be used to publish results of experiments for a broader audience, which advocates transparency of scientific work in the area of metaheuristics.},

 abstract = {Computer experiments are part of the daily business for many researchers within the area of computational intelligence. However, there is no standard for either human or computer readable documentation of computer experiments. Such a standard could considerably improve the collaboration between experimental researchers, given it is intuitive to use. In response to this deficiency the Intelligent Parameter Tool ( InPUT ) is introduced. InPUT offers a general and programming language independent format for the definition of parameters and their ranges. It provides services to simplify the implementation of algorithms and can be used as a substitute for input mechanisms of existing frameworks. InPUT reduces code-complexity and increases the reusability of algorithm designs as well as the reproducibility of experiments. InPUT is available as open-source for Java and this will soon also be extended to C++, two of the predominant languages of choice for the development of evolutionary algorithms.},

Furthermore, in dimension 5, we present the results of the ACOR when it uses variable correlation handling.

The enhanced algorithm termed as direction-based RCGA (DBRCGA) uses relative fitness information to direct the crossover toward a direction that significantly improves the objective fitness. As a base of performance evaluation and comparisons, the maximum number of function evaluations (#FEs) for each test run is set to 105 times to the problem dimension. Extensive benchmarking test results reveal that all functions can be solved by DBRCGA in the low search dimensions. Although the DBRCGA shows the difficulty in getting a solution with the desired accuracy 10-8 for high conditioning and multimodal functions within the specified maximum #FEs, the DBRCGA presents good performance in separable function and functions with low or moderate conditioning.},

DEAE is compared against pure DE, an adaptive version of DE (JADE), and an evolutionary strategy with covariance matrix adaptation (CMA-ES). The results suggest that AE indeed improves the performance of DE, particularly on the group of unimodal non-separable functions, but the adaptation of parameters used in JADE is more profitable on average. The use of AE inside JADE is envisioned.},

We find that additional mirrored mutations improve the IPOP active CMA-ES statistically significantly, but by only a small margin, on several functions while never a statistically significant performance decline can be observed. Furthermore, experiments on different function instances with some algorithm parameters and stopping criteria changed reveal essentially the same results.},

In this study, we investigate the difference between the performance of the two variants empirically on the noiseless BBOB testbed.

This hybrid algorithm is applied to the standard benchmark sets and compared with other approaches. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm could obtain the high-quality solutions within relatively short computation time. Meanwhile, the convergence of HPTS is proved.

 abstract = {A water distribution contamination event occurs when a chemical or pathogen is introduced to a pipe network dedicated to the delivery of potable water. During an event, complex interactions among consumers, utility operators, decision makers, and the pipe network can influence the number of exposed consumers, as human actors adapt their water use activities in response to warnings or exposure. An agent-based model is developed to model the water contamination event and provides insight and understanding about the effect of interactions on public health, such as the number of exposed consumers. Utility operators can protect consumers using a wide range of mitigation responses, and opening a set of hydrants is typically an effective strategy for flushing contaminated water before it reaches consumers. The ABM framework is coupled with an Evolutionary Strategy (ES)-based search to identify an optimal strategy for manipulating hydrants to minimize the number of exposed consumers. The application of the simulation-optimization framework is demonstrated for a virtual mid-sized municipality, Mesopolis.},

Inventing such an algorithm usually involves a tedious reasoning process for each individual idea. In this paper, we report preliminary results in our effort to push the boundary of the discovery process even further, by replacing the classical approach with a guided search strategy that makes use of genetic programming targeting the NetLogo simulator. The effort moves from a manual model implementation to an automated discovery process. The only activity that is required is the implementation of primitives and the configuration of the tool-chain.

Our Artificial Life system, called \mbox{GReaNs}, is based on a model of a gene regulatory network (GRN), encoded in a linear genome, and a model of multicellular development. Animat bodies are created by converting cells to point masses and connecting nearby cells with elastic springs. Outer cells form a skin, an external envelope subjected to fluid drag. Each cell can modify the resting length of the springs attached to it, which creates motion in the animat. We review results that we obtained through two approaches for evolvable control. In the first approach, the spring contractions and extensions follow the sine function. The frequency, phase, and amplitude associated with a particular spring are determined at the end of development, by the state of the GRN in the two cells controlling the spring. The parameters remain fixed as the animat moves. In the second approach, the GRN controls the cell's springs in real time, and cells can also communicate through diffusive signals. Various locomotion modes based on diverse morphologies emerge in both setups, including undulation and the use of primitive appendages.},

The survival of both was for the first time determined by interactions between animals some distance apart.

We derive IMFs between scales to calculate data driven center surround maps which locally reflect amount of information in the scene and we combine opposition color channels, luminosity information and orientation maps into a single saliency map calculated on IMFs. To equalize influence of different components contributing to the final saliency map, normalization steps are proposed. Finally, the MSER regions are calculated directly on the saliency map in order to obtain the most dominant points.

It is hypothesized here that a reward function which evaluates the fulfillment of a task requiring memory does not necessarily reward the stepping stones to this cognitive ability. This question is studied from an evolutionary robotics perspective. Both structure and parameters of a neural network supposed to exhibit a memory are generated through an evolutionary search. Results show that selective pressures driving the evolutionary search are of critical importance. We further hypothesize that one feature of controllers with a memory is their ability to exhibit consistent behaviors over different contexts. To validate this hypothesis, a new fitness objective rewarding behavior consistency in different contexts is introduced and tested on a T-maze ER task --- a task involving both navigation and working memory. The efficiency of the fitness objective is studied, as well as its effects on the overall performance and generalization ability of the controller. Results show that it is complementary to a behavioral diversity objective, thus leading to improved results when using both selection pressures.},

The future application of these methods to metaheuristics can yield advanced self-adaptive metaheuristics and knowledge bases that can take the role of expert systems in the field of optimization. One important feature of such an expert system would be the prediction of algorithm effort on a certain instance. Estimating whether a certain algorithm is able to tackle the problem adequately or not is a valuable piece of information that currently only an experienced human expert can give. The ability to generate such an advice automatically is, therefore, an important milestone. While fitness landscape analysis methods have been developed for exactly this purpose, it has been shown in the past that single-value analyses have limited applicability. Here, a general method for extracting fitness landscape features will be shown in combination with regression models that indicate a strong correlation between the actual and the predicted effort. Significant potential to increase the prediction quality arises when combining several measures each derived from several different sampling trajectories.},

 abstract = {Many potential target problems for genetic programming are modal in the sense that qualitatively different modes of response are required for inputs from different regions of the problem's domain. This paper presents a new approach to solving modal problems with genetic programming, using a simple and novel parent selection method called lexicase selection. It then shows how the differential performance of genetic programming with and without lexicase selection can be used to provide a measure of problem modality, and it argues that defining such a measure in this way is not as methodologically problematic as it may initially appear. The modality measure is illustrated through the analysis of genetic programming runs on a simple modal symbolic regression problem. This is a preliminary report that is intended in part to stimulate discussion on the significance of modal problems, methods for solving them, and methods for measuring the modality of problems. Although the core concepts in this paper are presented in the context of genetic programming, they are also relevant to applications of other forms of evolutionary computation to modal problems.},

 abstract = {In developing effective search and optimization algorithms, it is crucial that the specific features of the problem be taken into account. This observation has led to a great deal of research in how to abstract away trivial details in favor of the core concept that describes such features, with the goal of developing a more general theory of search algorithm performance. However, our efforts have not taken advantage of the great developments in data-driven machine learning that have arisen in the past decade or so. Rather, most work still starts from a clean slate and focuses on collecting and analysing only the limited landscape data that each researcher deems useful for each specific problem. In this position paper, I argue for the development of an open repository of this data -- open both in the sense of freely available to all researchers as well as in the sense of an open-world assumption concerning the types of data to be collected and analyzed. This paper discusses some of the important issues that would need to be resolved to build such a system in a way that would provide the most value for the field.},

Inferences about the underlying system can only be made when a sufficient number of runs are performed to estimate the relevant metric within some confidence interval. This paper proposes a new algorithm for determining the minimum number of independent runs needed to make inferences about a GP system. As such, we view our algorithm as a meta-metric that should be satisfied before any inferences about a system are made. We call this metric COSMOS, as it estimates the number of independent runs needed to achieve the Convergence Of Sample Means Of the Order Statistics. It is agnostic to the underlying GP system and can be used to evaluate extant performance metrics, as well as problem difficulty. We suggest ways for which COSMOS may be used to identify problems for which GP may be uniquely qualified to solve.},

 abstract = {Evolutionary Computation and Swarm Intelligence (SI) are currently some of the scientific research fields where scientists and artists seek for tools and inspiration for creating what is known as generative art. Within the SI field, social insects and the concept of stigmergy, in particular, have inspired several significant artworks that question the borders and nature of creativity. This paper addresses generative art created with SI systems and presents a set of images that correspond to a working mechanism of an ant-based clustering algorithm, which uses data samples that interact via the environment and generate what we call abstract swarm paintings. The algorithm, called KANTS, consists in a simple set of equations that model the local behavior of the ants (data samples) in a way that, when travelling on a heterogeneous 2-dimensional lattice of vectors, they tend to form clusters according to the class of each sample. The algorithm was previously proposed for clustering. In this paper, KANTS is used outside a purely scientific framework and applied to data extracted from sleep-Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. With such data, the lattice vectors have three variables, which are used for generating the RGB values of a colored image. Therefore, from the action of the swarm on the environment, we get 2-dimensional colored abstract sketches of human sleep. We call these images pherogenic drawings, since the data used for creating them are actually visual representations of the algorithm's pheromone maps. As a visualization and creative tool, the method is contextualized within the swarm art field.},

In addition, a novel ranking method is presented called the Ordered Trial Rank (OTR) that is designed for use with results that contain a large number of related sets of samples - e.g. a group of algorithm performance results on the same problem. The OTR is compared against simple median and standard deviation scores and shown to provide a better statistical distinction between the sets of results.

Conversely, discarding objectives so that the solutions can be visualised in two or three spatial dimensions results in a loss of potentially important information. We demonstrate four methods for visualising many-objective populations, two of which use the complete set of objectives to present solutions in a clear and intuitive fashion and two that compress the objectives of a population into two dimensions whilst minimising the information that is lost. All of the techniques are illustrated on populations of solutions to optimisation test problems.},

This work examines the composition of rhythms through L and Finite L-systems (FL-systems) and presents an interpretation from grammatical to rhythmic entities that expresses the repetitiveness and diversity of the output of these systems. Furthermore, we use a supervised training scheme that uses Genetic Algorithms (GA) to evolve the rules of L and FL-systems, so that they may compose rhythms with certain characteristics. Simple rhythmic indicators are introduced that describe the density, pauses, self similarity, symmetry and syncopation of rhythms. With fitness evaluations based on these indicators we assess the performance of L and FL-systems and present results that indicate the superiority of the FL-system in terms of adaptability to certain rhythmic tasks.},

And, does graphical model analysis indicate a better way to control the search bias for symbolic regression - by operator design, size control, bloat control or other means?},

The experimental design for SR can somehow be tricky, because of interactions in the parameter settings. Methods for handling configurations of parameters which depend on higher-level parameters will be presented.

We present a function discovery technology based on symbolic regression that routinely converts these problems into meaningful and insightful models with robust driver features identification.

 abstract = {In many disease models, the dynamics are described by a system of differential equations. When the spread of the disease is controlled by a treatment strategy, an obvious challenge is to find the best treatment possible. Mathematically, this problem is known as optimal control, or dynamic optimization. To solve these problems, researchers are increasingly turning to evolutionary optimization methods. Evolutionary computation, however, operates on discrete, n-dimensional vectors, not on continuous functions, and becomes computationally unmanageable for large n. Thus a parameterization technique is required, that can represent arbitrary functions with a small number of parameters. The typical approach to parameterization in epidemiological and biomedical models is to approximate the control functions as piecewise constant. We show the limitations of this approach, and demonstrate a recently developed method, Bezier Control Parameterization (BCP). With relatively few parameters, BCP can represent continuous control functions, and provides an efficient and effective parameterization method for evolutionary control of disease models.},

Starting from CT data we extract the suspected tumors represented as approximating metaballs and calculate malignancy indexes based on precise volume and surface irregularity evaluation. The mentioned approximation is performed resolving a constraint problem using a genetic algorithm whose objective function is a mathematical representation of the metaball. Compared to existing art, the metaball approximation provides a consistent reference surface for the evaluation of novel diagnosis parameters borrowed from engineering surface analysis. We have implemented the method in a demonstrator software and analyzed three different test cases.},

In this paper, we analyze the performance of a novel feature-deselective neuroevolution method called FD-NEAT to retain relevant features derived from CT images and evolve neural networks that perform well for combined feature selection and classification. Network performance is analyzed based on radiologists' ratings of various lung nodule characteristics defined in the LIDC database. The analysis shows that the FD-NEAT classifier relates well with the radiologists' perception in almost all the defined nodule characteristics, and shows that FD-NEAT evolves networks that are less complex than the fixed-topology ANN in terms of number of connections.},

The timing and extent of interaction between these sub-populations can be flexibly controlled by the user. Resultant differences between sub-populations provides data with which to compare the different strategy generating functions.

A fitness function that rewards both motif conservation and motif length is used to evolve a population of conserved motifs of variable length. This paper describes the motivation for GAMIV, discusses the design of the system, and presents initial results for the system. Based on these initial results, GAMIV is a promising tool for the inference of variable-length motifs in noncoding DNA.},

 abstract = {The detection of gene-gene and gene-interactions in genetic association studies is an important challenge in human genetics. The detection of such interactive models presents a difficult computational and statistical challenge, especially as advances in genotyping technology have rapidly expanded the number of potential genetic predictors in such studies. The scale of these studies makes exhaustive search approaches infeasible, inspiring the application of evolutionary computation algorithms to perform variable selection and build classification models. Recently, an application of grammatical evolution to evolve decision trees (GEDT) has been introduced for detecting interaction models. Initial results were promising, but the previous applications of GEDT have been limited to case-control studies with unrelated individuals. While this study design is popular in human genetics, other designs with related individuals offer distinct advantages. Specifically, a trio-based design (with genetic data for an affected individual and their parents collected) can be a powerful approach to mapping that is robust to population heterogeneity and other potential confounders. In the current study, we extend the GEDT approach to be able to handle trio data (trioGEDT), and demonstrate its potential in simulated data with gene-gene interactions that underlie disease risk.},

This ability is useful both when looking for candidate motifs in co-expressed genes (where it is not expected that all genes respond to the same transcription factors) and when looking for candidate motifs in divergent species (where functional elements might appear only in related species). In these cases, we would like to allow the inferred motif to be present in only a subset of the input data. By excluding some sequences from the match process, GAMID succeeded at finding known functional elements. Here we use the results of experiments using artificial data with GAMID to show that GAMID's success in inferring motifs in subsets of the input data results in it finding fewer motifs when they are present in all the sequences. Therefore, GAMID is useful as an adjunct tool to GAMI, but is not a replacement for its functionality.},

In PC, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is adopted to draw the ideal coordinate system from the difference vectors distribution. In the numerical experiments, PC is combined with two versions of classical DE algorithms to test its ability. The first experiment measures the accuracy of the coordinate system obtained by PC. In the second experiment, four benchmark functions and an engineering project are used to evaluate PC's efficiency. The results show that PC improves DE's efficiency, robustness and stability.},

However, evolutionary design is limited by the ability of a simulation to accurately represent the physical world. Additionally, evolved designs carry no set of specific instructions describing how to physically create such a design. Our approach, called Evolutionary Fabrication, evolves a \emph{process} rather than a product. This system of evolution can, in principle, automatically invent and build anything, from soft robots to new toys. We have implemented Evolutionary Fabrication in designing EvoFab, a machine that consists of four components: A) a genotype for printing objects, consisting of a linear set of instructions sent to a Fab@Home, an open-source 3D printer; B) a way to evaluate printed objects using custom machine vision algorithms; C) a way to automate printing by implementing a custom conveyor belt; D) a way of elaborating upon designs by implementing a genetic algorithm. In the near term, we aim to produce an evolved arch. Current results indicate increased fitness over time. Future improvements are possible through restrictions in extrusion along the Y-axis as well as refining fitness evaluation to be less exploitable.},

There are past works using dynamic programming to calculate the plate appearance and using Markov Chain to evaluate a batting order. These two algorithms summarize all past data to deliver an optimal batting order. The GA described here applies an evaluation function using a baseball game simulation. Thus the GA is more like a helping tool that can be incorporated into the decision making process rather than a deterministic tool. The simulation defines the baseball game as a set of events. By using only a subset of the event set, the decision maker can pursue a customized batting order.},

Therefore, grammatical evolution of decision trees (GEDT) is being considered as an alternative, as decision trees are easily interpretable for clinicians. Previously, the most effective parameters for GEDT and GENN were found using parameter sweeps. Since GEDT is much more intuitive and easy to understand, it becomes important to compare its predictive power to that of GENN. We show that it is not as effective as GENN at detecting disease causing polymorphisms especially in more difficult to detect models, but this power trade off may be worth it for interpretability.},

In this work, our system incrementally adds or deletes filters based on user's evaluation on the results of image retouching. Recently, people take photos using their smartphones and it is not a trivial to give a number of consecutive evaluations to guide the IEC search. Based on the observation, we try to compare several scoring methods for the IEC to get the best results for the image retouching system. They are a simple binary scoring (Good & Bad), discrete multiple choices (Five Star), and real-valued scoring (Slider). Experimental results on five human subjects show that the Good & Bad is appropriate for the retouching system.},

In this paper, an improved version, namely the GeDEA-II, is proposed which features a novel crossover operator, the Simplex-Crossover, and a novel mutation operator, the Shrink-Mutation. GeDEM operator was left unchanged and completed using the non-dominatedsorting based on crowding distance. The comparison among GeDEA-II and GeDEA, as well as with three other modern elitist methods, on different extremely multidimensional test problems, clearly indicates that the performance of GeDEA-II is, at least in these cases, superior.},

 abstract = {Transition states constitute an essential component of the chemical reaction rate theory and are important for understanding the structural and mechanical properties of the systems, and how they react under different environmental conditions. The challenges behind the discovery of transition states however arise from the existence of a large number of rules and constraints as well as the computational complexity involved in energy calculations. In this paper, we present some recent successes of memetic computation and experiences for the discovery of first-order saddle points or transition states in biochemical systems. We show that the exploitation of a priori knowledge on the inherent structure of the problem in the form of memetic search operators led to enhanced search convergence and solution quality. This paper then concludes with a brief discussion on the potentials for the redefinition of memes not only as symbiosis of search operators but as building blocks for complex biochemical systems.},

The user can change the morphology of the robot and test the new design iteratively, altering the design based on the assessment of the robot's performance after a period of evolution of the controller.

It should be converted into a Lisp code, or needs a custom-made virtual machine or interpreter to execute the program generated. Recently, there is a study on genetic programming directly using Java bytecode, a practical intermediate language. It evolves a series of commands that manipulate stack and registers in the virtual machine and represents them with a simple list data structure instead of tree. Evolving the intermediate language is promising because 1) it is easy to combine an existing program with an automatically generated program, 2) there are several available development tools and environments for the language including virtual machine, decompiler, optimizer and so on, and 3) incorporating the list data structure into the evolutionary algorithm is simple and straightforward. In this research, we propose to evolve bytecode of Python programming language by stack-based genetic programming. Python is a flexible and popular programming language powered by plenty of research tools. For the evolution, we developed representation and genetic operations for the Python language. We report that the proposed method produced successful Python codes for two regression problems.},

The main goal of evolution is then to find the best ordering of the instruction blocks, with possible repetitions. When the fitness remains stalled, ignored instruction blocks, which have a low probability to be useful, are replaced. Experiments show that PhenoGP achieve competitive results against standard LGP.},

Empirical results show that restricted tournament replacement (RTR) that hBOA employs results in spurious linkages and increases difficulty on solving CPF. Our research consists of these goals: (1) proposing a mutual information matrix to approximate the implicit linkage-information during EDAs' execution, (2) reducing spurious linkages by using new metric of similarity, and (3) maintaining diversity of population. The results show that hBOA with our proposed niching method reduces the spurious linkages and solves CPF in the polynomial time.},

In this paper we experiment with a model for bimatrix games, where the goal of the players is to find robust strategies for which the uncertainty in the outcome of the opponent is reduced as much as possible. We show that in an evolutionary setting, the proposed model converges to mixed strategy profiles, if these exist.

 abstract = {This paper presents a new interactive evolutionary approach for the vehicle routing problem. After a short review of main interactive optimization systems, we describe an evolutionary algorithm based on a set of human-computer interaction techniques. With a graphical display of the current population of solutions, a human can visually identify interesting route segments and tag them accordingly. Human annotations are taken into consideration in the evolutionary operators during the optimization process. Our interactive optimization approach is under experimental validation and user tests on benchmark problems are carried out to investigate the human-algorithm interaction.},

While sharing the evolutionary inspired algorithm principles of a genetic algorithm, it differs by exploiting an executable genome. Genetic programming evolves a 'program' to solve a problem rather than a single solution. This tutorial introduces the basic genetic programming framework. It explains how the powerful capability of genetic programming is derived from modular algorithmic components: executable representations such as an abstract syntax tree, variation operators that preserve syntax and explore a variable length, hierarchical solution space, appropriately chosen programming functions and fitness function specification},

 abstract = {Many optimization problems are multiobjective in nature in the sense that multiple, conflicting criteria need to be optimized simultaneously. Due to the conflict between objectives, usually, no single optimal solution exists. Instead, the optimum corresponds to a set of so-called Pareto-optimal solutions for which no other solution has better function values in all objectives. Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization (EMO) algorithms are widely used in practice for solving multiobjective optimization problems due to several reasons. As randomized blackbox algorithms, EMO approaches allow to tackle problems with nonlinear, nondifferentiable, or noisy objective functions. As set-based algorithms, they allow to compute or approximate the full set of Pareto-optimal solutions in one algorithm run---opposed to classical solution-based techniques from the multicriteria decision making (MCDM) field. Using EMO approaches in practice has two other advantages: they allow to learn about a problem formulation, for example, by automatically revealing common design principles among (Pareto-optimal) solutions (innovization) and it has been shown that certain single-objective problems become easier to solve with randomized search heuristics if the problem is reformulated as a multiobjective one (multiobjectivization).

This tutorial aims at giving a broad introduction to the EMO field and at presenting some of its recent research results in more detail. More specifically, we are going to (i) introduce the basic principles of EMO algorithms in comparison to classical solution-based approaches, (ii) show a few practical examples which motivate the use of EMO in terms of the mentioned innovization and multiobjectivization principles, and (iii) present a general overview of state-of-the-art algorithms and techniques. Moreover, we will present some of the most important research results in areas such as indicator-based EMO, preference articulation, and performance assessment.

Though classified as introductory, this tutorial is intended for both novices and regular users of EMO. Those without any knowledge will learn about the foundations of multiobjective optimization and the basic working principles of state-of-the-art EMO algorithms. Open questions, presented throughout the tutorial, can serve for all participants as a starting point for future research and/or discussions during the conference.},

However, EDAs are not only optimization techniques; besides the optimum or its approximation, EDAs provide practitioners with a series of probabilistic models that reveal a lot of information about the problem being solved. This information can in turn be used to design problem-specific neighborhood operators for local search, to bias future runs of EDAs on a similar problem, or to create an efficient computational model of the problem. The tutorial Probabilistic Model-Building GAs provides an introduction to PMBGAs with an overview of major research directions in this area.},

 abstract = {Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), when used for global optimization, can be seen as unconstrained optimization techniques. Therefore, they require an additional mechanism to incorporate constraints of any kind (i.e., inequality, equality, linear, nonlinear) into their fitness function. Although the use of penalty functions (very popular with mathematical programming techniques) may seem an obvious choice, this sort of approach requires a careful fine tuning of the penalty factors to be used. Otherwise, an EA may be unable to reach the feasible region (if the penalty is too low) or may reach quickly the feasible region but being unable to locate solutions that lie in the boundary with the infeasible region (if the penalty is too severe).

This has motivated the development of a number of approaches to incorporate constraints into the fitness function of an EA. This tutorial will cover the main proposals in current use, including novel approaches such as the use of tournament rules based on feasibility, multiobjective optimization concepts, hybrids with mathematical programming techniques (e.g., Lagrange multipliers), cultural algorithms, and artificial immune systems, among others. Other topics such as the importance of maintaining diversity, current benchmarks and the use of alternative search engines (e.g., particle swarm optimization, differential evolution, evolution strategies, etc.) will be also discussed (as time allows).},

 abstract = {Successful and efficient use of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) depends on the choice of the genotype, the problem representation (mapping from genotype to phenotype) and on the choice of search operators that are applied to the genotypes. These choices cannot be made independently of each other. The question whether a certain representation leads to better performing EAs than an alternative representation can only be answered when the operators applied are taken into consideration. The reverse is also true: deciding between alternative operators is only meaningful for a given representation. In EA practice one can distinguish two complementary approaches. The first approach uses indirect representations where a solution is encoded in a standard data structure, such as strings, vectors, or discrete permutations, and standard off-the-shelf search operators are applied to these genotypes. To evaluate the solution, the genotype needs to be mapped to the phenotype space. The proper choice of this genotype-phenotype mapping is important for the performance of the EA search process. The second approach, the direct representation, encodes solutions to the problem in its most 'natural' space and designs search operators to operate on this representation.

Research in the last few years has identified a number of key concepts to analyse the influence of representation-operator combinations on EA performance. These concepts are *locality and *redundancy. Locality is a result of the interplay between the search operator and the genotype-phenotype mapping. Representations are redundant if the number of phenotypes exceeds the number of possible genotypes. Furthermore, redundant representations can lead to biased encodings if some phenotypes are on average represented by a larger number of genotypes. Finally, a bias need not be the result of the representation but can also be caused by the search operator.

The tutorial gives a brief overview about existing guidelines for representation design, illustrates the different aspects of representations, gives a brief overview of theoretical models describing the different aspects, and illustrates the relevance of the aspects with practical examples. It is expected that the participants have a basic understanding of EA principles.},

While this convention is widespread, in nature the mapping is not direct. Instead, the genotype maps to the phenotype through a process of development, which means that each gene may be activated multiple times and in multiple places in the process of constructing the phenotype.

This tutorial will examine why such indirect mapping may be critical to the continuing success of evolutionary computation. Rather than just an artifact of nature, indirect mapping means that vast phenotypic spaces (e.g. the 100 trillion connection human brain) can be searched effectively in a space of far fewer genes (e.g. the 30,000 gene human genome). The tutorial will introduce this research area, called Generative and Developmental Systems (GDS), by surveying milestones in the field and introducing its most profound puzzles. Most importantly, what is the right abstraction of natural development to capture its essential advantages without introducing unnecessary overhead into the search?},

These impacts stem both from the absolute computational power of the languages that are used, as elucidated by formal language theory, and from the ease with which various computational structures can be produced by random code generation and by the action of genetic operators. Highly expressive languages can facilitate the evolution of programs for any computable function using, when appropriate, multiple data types, evolved subroutines, evolved control structures, evolved data structures, and evolved modular program and data architectures. In some cases expressive languages can even support the evolution of programs that express methods for their own reproduction and variation (and hence for the evolution of their offspring). This tutorial will begin with a comparative survey of approaches to the evolution of programs in expressive programming languages ranging from machine code to graphical and grammatical representations. Within this context it will then provide a detailed introduction to the Push programming language, which was designed specifically for expressiveness and specifically for use in genetic programming systems. Push programs are syntactically unconstrained but can nonetheless make use of multiple data types and express arbitrary control structures, supporting the evolution of complex, modular programs in a particularly simple and flexible way. The Push language will be described and ten years of Push-based research, including the production of human-competitive results, will be briefly surveyed. The tutorial will conclude with a discussion of recent enhancements to Push that are intended to support the evolution of complex and robust software systems.},

 abstract = {One of the most commonly-used metaphors to describe the process of heuristic search methods in solving combinatorial optimization problems is that of a fitness landscape. The landscape metaphor appears most commonly in work related to evolutionary algorithms, however, it can be used for search in general; the search space can be regarded as a spatial structure where each point (solution) has a height (objective function value) forming a landscape surface. In this scenario, the search process would be an adaptive-walk over a landscape that can range from having many peaks of high fitness flanked by cliffs falling to profound valleys of low fitness, to being smooth, with low hills and gentle valleys. Combinatorial landscapes can be seen as a graph whose vertices are the possible configurations. If two configurations can be transformed into each other by a suitable operator move, then we can trace an edge between them. The resulting graph, with an indication of the fitness at each vertex, is a representation of the given problem fitness landscape. The study of the fitness landscape consists in analyzing this graph or a relevant partition of it, with respect to the search dynamics or problem difficulty. This advanced tutorial will give an overview of the origins of the fitness landscape metaphor, and will cover the alternative ways to define fitness landscapes in evolutionary computation. The two main geometries: multimodal and neutral landscapes, which correspond to two different graph partitions found in combinatorial optimization, will be considered, as well as the dynamics of metaheurhistics searching on them. Furthermore, the relationship between problem hardness and fitness landscape metrics (i.e. autocorrelation, fitness distance correlation, neutral degree, etc), and the local optima network properties, studied in recent work, will be deeply analyzed. Finally, the tutorial will conclude with a brief survey of open questions and recent research directions on fitness landscapes.},

While the field of AIS is a relatively new area of research, it has achieved numerous promising results in different areas of application, e.g., learning, classification, anomaly detection, and optimization. In this tutorial we focus in particular on AIS build for the purpose of optimization. From an algorithmic point of view AIS show on a high level similarities to other biologically inspired algorithms, e.g. evolutionary algorithms. Due to their different origin concrete AIS for optimization are quite different from evolutionary algorithms. They constitute an interesting alternative approach to current methods. The tutorial gives an overview over different methods in the field of AIS. It addresses everyone who wants to broaden his or her area of research within this emerging field, both practitioners and theoreticians. It enables attendees without prior knowledge of AIS to learn about a novel kind of optimization method that can be used as an alternative to other biologically inspired algorithms. Moreover, it gives researchers with prior knowledge of AIS the opportunity to deepen their understanding of the considered algorithms.

We start with an overview over the different areas of AIS, including different general approaches and some immunological background. Afterwards, we discuss several examples of AIS for optimization. We introduce concrete algorithms and their implementations and point out similarities and differences to other biologically inspired algorithms. In the last part of the tutorial, we present an overview over recent theoretical results for this kind of algorithms.},

 abstract = {Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) is an increasingly popular and efficient form of Genetic Programming that was developed by Julian Miller in 1999 and 2000. In its classic form, it uses a very simple integer based genetic representation of a program in the form of a directed graph. Graphs are very useful program representations and can be applied to many domains (e.g. electronic circuits, neural networks). In a number of studies, CGP has been shown to be comparatively efficient to other GP techniques. It is also very simple to program.

Since then, the classical form of CGP has been developed made more efficient in various ways. Notably, by including automatically defined functions (modular CGP) and self-modification operators (self-modifying CGP). SMCGP was developed by Julian Miller, Simon Harding and Wolfgang Banzhaf. It uses functions that cause the evolved programs to change themselves as a function of time. Using this technique it is possible to find general solutions to classes of problems and mathematical algorithms (e.g. arbitrary parity, n-bit binary addition, sequences that provably compute pi and e to arbitrary precision, and so on).

The tutorial will cover the basic technique, advanced developments and applications to a variety of problem domains.},

 abstract = {The field of biological sciences has been transformed in recent years to a domain of incredibly rich data ripe for computational exploration. High throughput technologies allow investigators to construct vast feature sets, including genetic variables, gene expression values, protein levels, biomarkers, and a multitude of other traits. These rich feature sets can be used to predict disease risk and prioritize treatment strategies, but there are incredible challenges in the analysis of such data. Features often have correlation patterns, are subject to normalization, measurement errors, and other forms of noise. Furthermore, there are far more features in a typical dataset than there are samples. Despite these issues, the analysis of complex biological data can lead to a new understanding of biological systems and human health.

This tutorial provides an introduction to the fundamental concepts of biological science. It examines the established methods for generating biological datasets, outlines online databases that contain much of this data, and introduces the newest methods for capturing high-resolution genomic sequence data. Attendees will leave this tutorial with a better understanding of the problem domains that exist in biological science.},

Robust data mining tools, able to cope with petascale volumes and/or high dimensionality producing human-understandable solutions are key on several domain areas. Genetics-based machine learning (GBML) techniques are perfect candidates for this task. Recent advances in representations, learning paradigms, and theoretical modelling have showed the competitiveness of non EC techniques in herding large scale data analysis. If evolutionary learning techniques aspire to be a relevant player in this context, they need to have the capacity of processing these vast amounts of data and they need to process this data within reasonable time. Moreover, massive computation cycles are getting cheaper and cheaper every day, allowing researchers to have access to unprecedented computational resources on the edge of petascale computing. Several topics are interlaced in these two requirements: (1) having the proper learning paradigms and knowledge representations, (2) understanding them and knowing when are they suitable for the problem at hand, (3) using efficiency enhancement techniques, and (4) transforming and visualizing the produced solutions to give back as much insight as possible to the domain experts are few of them.

This tutorial will try to shed light to the above mentioned questions, following a roadmap that starts exploring what large scale means, and why large is a challenge and opportunity for GBML methods. As we will show later, opportunity has multiple facets: Efficiency enhancement techniques, representations able to cope with large dimensionality spaces, scalability of learning paradigms, and alternative programming models, each of them helping to make GBML very attractive for large-scale data mining. Given these building blocks, we will continue to unfold how we can model the scalability of the components of GBML systems targeting a better engineering effort that will make embracing large datasets routine. Finally, we will illustrate how all these ideas fit by reviewing real applications of GBML systems and what further directions will require serious consideration.},

 abstract = {Hyper-heuristics comprise a set of approaches which are motivated (at least in part) by the goal of automating the design of heuristic methods to solve hard computational search problems. An underlying strategic research challenge is to develop more generally applicable search methodologies. The term hyper-heuristic is relatively new; it was firstly used in 2000 to describe 'heuristics to choose heuristics' in the context of combinatorial optimization. However, the idea of automating the design of heuristics is not new; it can be traced back to the 1960s and 1970s, and a number of related research areas can be identified.

The definition of hyper-heuristics has been recently extended to refer to 'a search method or learning mechanism for selecting or generating heuristics to solve computational search problems'. Two main hyper-heuristic categories can be considered: heuristic selection and heuristic generation. The distinguishing feature of hyper-heuristics is that they operate on a search space of heuristics (or heuristic components) rather than directly on the search space of solutions to the underlying problem that is being addressed.

This tutorial will discuss the motivation, definition and classification of hyper-heuristics. The tutorial will also cover a recent international research competition: the first 'Cross-domain Heuristic Search Challenge'(CHeSC 2011) (http://www.asap.cs.nott.ac.uk/chesc2011). The challenge was to design a search algorithm that works well, not only across different instances of the same problem, but also across different problem domains. Using a sport metaphor, it is the 'Decathlon' challenge of search heuristics. To support the competition, and to promote research in this area, a software framework (HyFlex) was developed, which features a common interface for dealing with different optimization problems. The tutorial will summarize the main features of HyFlex and the competition; and will present an analysis of the results, highlighting the design principles of the most successful cross-domain hyper-heuristics.},

 abstract = {Social animals as found in fish schools, bird flocks, bee hives, and ant colonies are able to solve highly complex problems in nature. This includes foraging for food, constructing astonishingly complex nests, and evading or defending against predators. Remarkably, these animals in many cases use very simple, decentralized communication mechanisms that do not require a single leader. This makes the animals perform surprisingly well, even in dynamically changing environments. The collective intelligence of such animals is known as swarm intelligence and it has inspired popular and very powerful optimization paradigms, including ant colony optimization (ACO) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). The theory of swarm intelligence has made rapid progress in the last 6 years. Following a very successful line of research in evolutionary computation, results on the computational complexity of swarm intelligence algorithms have appeared. These results shed light on the working principles of swarm intelligence algorithms, help to identify the impact of parameters and other design choices on performance, and contribute to a solid theoretical foundation of swarm intelligence.

This tutorial will give a comprehensive overview of recent theoretical results on swarm intelligence algorithms, with an emphasis on their computational complexity. In particular, it will be shown how techniques for the analysis of evolutionary algorithms can be used to analyze swarm intelligence algorithms and how the performance of swarm intelligence algorithms compares to that of evolutionary algorithms. The tutorial will be divided into a first, larger part on ACO and a second, smaller part on PSO.

For ACO we will consider simple variants of the MAX-MIN ant system. Investigations of example functions in pseudo-Boolean optimization demonstrate that the choice of the pheromone update strategy and the evaporation rate has a drastic impact on the running time, even for very simple functions like ONEMAX. In terms of combinatorial optimization problems, we will look at the performance of ACO for minimum spanning trees, shortest path problems, and the TSP.

For particle swarm optimization, the tutorial will cover results on PSO for pseudo-Boolean optimization as well as a discussion of theoretical results in continuous spaces.},

 abstract = {The aim of the tutorial is to introduce a formal, unified point of view on evolutionary algorithms across representations based on geometric ideas, and to present the benefits for both theory and practice brought by this novel perspective.

The key idea behind the geometric framework is that search operators are not defined directly on solution representations, but are defined on the structure of the search space by means of simple geometric shapes, such as balls and segments, that delimit the region of space that includes all possible offspring with respect to the location of their parents. These geometric definitions can be then rewritten as equivalent but operational definitions involving the underlying representation. For example, the operator termed uniform geometric crossover is defined as to produce offspring that are uniformely distributed in the segment between parents. When the uniform geometric crossover is instantiated to the space of real vectors endowed with the Euclidean distance, and to the space of binary strings with the Hamming distance it comes to coincide to familiar operators, the blend crossover for real vectors and the uniform crossover for binary strings, respectively. This natural dualility of geometric search operators allows us to define exactly the same search operator across representations in a strong mathematical sense. This possibility forms the basis of a geometric framework for the unification of evolutionary algorithms across representations.},

 abstract = {Biological evolution is a complex blend of ever changing structural stability, variability and emergence of new phenotypes, niches, ecosystems. We wish to argue that the evolution of life marks the end of a physics world view of law entailed dynamics. Our considerations depend upon discussing the variability of the very contexts of life: the interactions between organisms, biological niches and ecosystems. These are ever changing, intrinsically indeterminate and even unprestatable: we do not know ahead of time the niches which constitute the boundary conditions on selection. More generally, by the mathematical unprestatability of the phase space (space of possibilities), no laws of motion can be formulated for evolution. We call this radical emergence, from life to life. The purpose of this paper is the integration of variation and diversity in a sound conceptual frame and situate unpredictability at a novel theoretical level, that of the very phase space. Our argument will be carried on in close comparisons with physics and the mathematical constructions of phase spaces in that discipline. The role of (theoretical) symmetries as invariant preserving transformations will allow us to understand the nature of physical phase spaces and to stress the differences required for a sound biological theoretizing. In this frame, we discuss the novel notion of enablement. Life lives in a web of enablement and radical emergence. This will restrict causal analyses to differential cases (a difference that causes a difference). Mutations or other causal differences will allow us to stress that non conservation principles are at the core of evolution, in contrast to physical dynamics, largely based on conservation principles as symmetries. Critical transitions, the main locus of symmetry changes in physics, will be discussed, and lead to extended criticality as a conceptual frame for a better understanding of the living state of matter.},

Many of the most successful methods in neuroscience research draw their power from stripping away all but the structures or phenomena relevant to a particular experimental question--focusing on the problem at hand, and cutting out the distractions. The birth of the modern field one century ago is due to the discovery of a tissue staining protocol, the 'Golgi Stain', that marks only a small percentage of neurons in nervous tissue, but leaves the vast majority of them invisible, permitting visualization under the microscope of individual trees in what would otherwise have been an impenetrable forest. Today, with the advent of modern genetics and molecular biology, this same principle has been applied across countless brain areas and a broad set of questions about the anatomical configuration, function, development, and plasticity of the nervous system. Many of the most powerful and commonly employed tools--like Green Fluorescence Protein, Channelrhodopsin, and virus-mediated tracing of neuronal projections--are actually biological solutions to completely unrelated problems, such as how to get a jellyfish to glow green, how to convey photosensitivity to a unicellular organism, or how to spread the Rabies virus across an entire nervous system. These research tools, the product of millions of years of evolution (and a few years of human tinkering) yield datasets whose explanatory power draws from the fact that they, like the Golgi Stain, allow researchers to focus on the question at hand and filter out the surrounding noise.},

 abstract = {In ant colony optimization (ACO) methods, including Ant System and MAX-MIN Ant System, each ant stochastically generates its candidate solution, in a given iteration, based on the same pheromone and heuristic information as every other ant. Stubborn ants is an ACO variation in which if an ant generates a particular candidate solution in a given iteration, then the components of that solution will have a higher probability of being selected in the candidate solution generated by that ant in the next iteration. We evaluate this variation in the context of MAX-MIN Ant System using 41 instances of the Traveling Salesman Problem, and find that it improves solution quality to a statistically-significant extent.},

In this approach the bees are ranked via their fitness. Best bee is kept unaltered, whereas the other bees are reinitialized with help of some modifications based on the food source obtained by best bee. This type of raking system will always help bees (apart from best bee) to exploit areas in the vicinity of food source corresponding to best bee. mABC is validated over a benchmark suite of shifted functions suggested in CEC'2008 competition and compared with the methods like EPS-PSO, CCPSO2, etc. Various comparisons with dimensions greater than 100 show the performance of mABC in solving higher dimensional problems with less computational effort.},

The Canonical Particle Swarm Optimisation (CanPSO) has been used for the detection of continuous edges in such images. The Fully Informed Particle Swarm (FIPS) is another well-known version of PSO with interesting features to overcome noise but it has never been used to detect edges in noisy images. In this paper, the performance of CanPSO and FIPS is investigated for detecting edges in noisy images when they use different well-known static and dynamic topologies. A novel spatial random-meaningful topology is also developed and used within the PSO-based edge detection algorithm. Experimental results indicate that the localisation accuracy of the PSO-based edge detector with the novel topology is higher than other static and dynamic topologies in most cases.},

However with the continued acceleration in computational resources, the main bottleneck is now the time required for an investigator to create a robot simulator, a neural network, evolutionary algorithm and fitness function that together produce the desired behavior. Here we introduce a software framework that allows a user to conduct evolutionary robotics experiments without having to write any software themselves: the user defines the robot morphology, task environment and fitness function interactively; a neural network is constructed based on the robot's morphology; and an evolutionary algorithm optimizes desired behavior. We here show that this approach allows users to overcome one of the main limitations of evolutionary algorithms---recognizing and then preventing entrapment in local optima---in a continuous, code free manner.},

 abstract = {The Digital Enzyme model of control is based on the bottom-up, reactive process of signal transduction found in cells. An earlier study applied a specific instance of the this model to the foraging problem. Here, we extend the system and use it to explore a fundamental question in both biology and evolutionary computation, namely, whether environmental complexity is a driving factor for an organism's internal control structure. To address this question, we extended the original system to allow the open-ended evolution of the unique programs, instructions, and threads within each controller. With the extended model, we were able to evolve successful foraging strategies that nearly doubled the performance of strategies found in the earlier work. In response to increasing environmental complexity, we discovered a high degree of variation for the number of programs, threads, and instructions that produced successful strategies. These results imply that environmental complexity does not require evolutionary search methods to explore regions of the search space characterized by parallel and distributed control. However, strategies found within these regions were as successful as strategies governed by a single program and thread, highlighting the importance of evolutionary search techniques that enable the open-ended evolution of key internal control components.},

However, these co-evolution approaches don't consider some physical limitations of SRM robots and usually request longer evolution process due to extensive searching space.

However, there has been very limited success in designing higher order modules by assembling these simpler devices. The lack of robustness in these devices, fails them to work as successful parts in larger system in general. In this paper, we propose a evolutionary search method to construct a robust topology of gene regulatory network in which the concentrations of genes oscillate like a repressilator. This kind of oscillating network works as a clock in the biological system and has been in the center of attraction for long. However, the issue of robustness of the designed network remained less attended. Our genetic algorithm evolves oscillating gene regulatory network with a topology superior to other existing topologies in terms of robustness.},

 abstract = {Finding interactions among genes is one of the main problems in molecular biology. In this paper, we use a novel approach to model the gene's regulations, or Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs). We use a Recursive Neural Network (RNN) to model the networks, and then use Population Based Incremental Learning (PBIL) enhanced with K-means to find the optimum parameters of the Neural Network. We present experiments with real data, we compare our algorithm with others approaches by calculating different statistics for the solutions.},

 abstract = {The goal of linkage learning in evolutionary algorithms is to identify the interactions between variables of a problem. Knowing the linkage information helps search algorithms to find the optimum solution efficiently and reliably in hard problems. This paper presents a simple approach for linkage learning based on the graph theory. A graph is used as the structure to keep the the pairwise dependencies between variables of the problem. We call this graph 'the underlying dependency graph of the problem'. Then maximum spanning tree (MST) of the dependency graph is found. It is shown that MST contains all the necessary linkage if the dependency graph is built upon enough population. In this approach, pairwise dependencies calculated based on a perturbation based identification method, are used as the variable dependencies. The proposed approach has the advantage of being capable of learning the linkage without the need for the costly fit-to-data evaluations for model search. It is parameter-less and the algorithm description is simple. The proposed technique is tested on several benchmark problems and it is shown to be able to compete with similar approaches. Based on the experimental results it can successfully find the linkage groups in polynomial number of fitness evaluations.},

 abstract = {Static Task Scheduling Problem (STSP) in multiprocessors is a NP-Complete problem. HLFET is one of the simplest well-known heuristics designed to deal with it. Meta-heuristics like genetic algorithms and simulated annealing had also been applied to this problem. Cellular Automata (CA) have been recently used to solve STSP. The main feature of CA-based scheduling is the extraction of knowledge while scheduling an application and its subsequent reuse in other instances. An evolutionary algorithm is applied to search for efficient CA rules in learning phase. Previous works showed this approach is promising. However some desirable features have not been successfully exploited yet, such as: (i) the massive parallelism inherent to CA, (ii) the usage of an arbitrary number of processors and (iii) the reuse of evolved rules with competitive results. This paper presents a new model called SCAS-H (Synchronous Cellular Automata Scheduler initialized by Heuristics). Its major innovation is the usage of a heuristic based on HLFET to start up the CA rule evolution. Program graphs found in literature and others randomly generated were used in the experiments. Results show that SCAS-H overcame related models both in scheduling results as computational performance and it presented competitive results with meta-heuristics.},

 abstract = {Two key problems in a negotiation are: i) for the players to de- cide what issues to include in a negotiation, and ii) what strategy to use for negotiating over the chosen issues. In general, there will be many (say m) issues available for negotiation and the players must choose a subset of g < m issues and negotiate on them. The g issues thus chosen is called the negotiation agenda. An agent will choose the agenda that maximizes its utility and is therefore its optimal agenda. Once an agenda is chosen, a player must choose an optimal strategy since the final deal (and a player's profit from it) will depend on the strategy. In many real-world negotiations, a player's actual utility from a deal will not be defined completely. There may be some information about the utility but this information may not be complete. Such scenarios make the problems of finding optimal agendas and strategies more challenging. In order to overcome this challenge, we present a multi surrogate-based GA system. This system is comprised of two GAs and set of Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN) surrogates that work together to find an optimal agenda and also an optimal strategy for that agenda. We compare the performance of this system with a standard GA and random search.},

Most of contemporary community detection algorithms employ single optimization criteria (e.g., modularity), which may have fundamental disadvantages. This paper considers the community detection process as a Multi-Objective optimization Problem (MOP). To solve the community detection problem this study used modified harmony search algorithm (HAS), the original HAS often converges to local optima which is a disadvantage with this method. To avoid this shortcoming the HAS was combined with a Chaotic Local Search (CLS). In the proposed algorithm an external repository considered to save non-dominated solutions found during the search process and a fuzzy clustering technique was used to control the size of the repository. The experiments in synthetic and real networks show that the proposed multi-objective community detection algorithm is able to discover more accurate community structures.},

 abstract = {Current SoC (System-on-Chip) are characterized by the integration of larger amount of IPs targeting a wide range of application fields. Such multi-application systems are constrained by a set of security and performance requirements. Network-on-chip (NoC) is becoming important as the communication structure of the SoC. IP mapping is one of the most critical parameters in NoC design, strongly influencing the SoC performance. IP mapping has been solved for single application systems using single and multi-objective optimization algorithms. In this paper we propose the use of a multi-objective adaptive immune algorithm (M2AIA), an evolutionary approach to solve the multi-application NoC mapping problem targeting security issues, in order to group the IPs according the security characteristics while achieving the best performance. Latency and power consumption were adopted as the target multi-objective functions constrained by the security function. To compare the efficiency of our approach, our results are compared with those of the genetic and branch-and-bound multi-objective mapping algorithms. The experimental results showed that the M2AIA achieves configurations that fulfill the security requirements while decreasing the power consumption in 27percent and the latency in 42percent compared to the branch-and-bound approach and 29percent and 36percent over the genetic approach.},

 abstract = {Many relevant industrial optimization tasks feature more than just one quality criterion. State-of-the-art multi-criteria optimization algorithms require a relatively large number of function evaluations (usually more than 10^5) to approximate Pareto fronts. Due to high cost or time consumption this large amount of function evaluations is not always available. Therefore, it is obvious to combine techniques such as Sequential Parameter Optimization (SPO), which need a very small number of function evaluations only, with techniques from evolutionary multi-criteria optimization (EMO). In this paper, we show how EMO techniques can be efficiently integrated into the framework of the SPO Toolbox (SPOT). We discuss advantages of this approach in comparison to state-of-the-art optimizers. Moreover, with the resulting capability to allow competing objectives, the opportunity arises to not only aim for the best, but also for the most robust solution. Herein we present an approach to optimize not only the quality of the solution, but also its robustness, taking these two goals as objectives for multi-criteria optimization into account.},

 abstract = {Behavioral Diversity (BD) aims at improving the evolution of robots by fostering exploration on the basis of their behavior, whereas evolutionary algorithms typically consider the diversity on a genotypic level. Several Behavioral Similarity Measures (BSM), the key component to improve behavioral diversity, have been investigated in the litterature. Current benchmarks show that (1) most tested BSM improve the final performance, (2) they do not lead to the same improvements and, (3) it is hard to predict a priori which BSM will work the best. Instead of trying to find the best BSM, a different approach is proposed here: assuming that several BSM are available, we propose to randomly switch between then each K generations (e.g. K=20). This new approach is tested on a ball collecting task. Results show that better fitness values are obtained with the random switch approach than with any single measure. In effect, the present contribution show that it is possible use behavioral diversity while avoiding to choose between behavioral similarity measures.},

Class probabilities are adapted based on their expected fitness, starting with a prior biased toward the simplest networks. Experiments on a challenging non-linear version of the helicopter hovering task, show that the method consistently finds simple solutions.},

 abstract = {The hyperclimbing hypothesis is a hypothetical explanation for adaptation in genetic algorithms with uniform crossover (UGAs). Hyperclimbing is an intuitive, general-purpose, non-local search heuristic applicable to discrete product spaces with rugged or stochastic cost functions. The strength of this heuristic lie in its insusceptibility to local optima when the cost function is deterministic, and its tolerance for noise when the cost function is stochastic. Hyperclimbing works by decimating a search space, i.e. by iteratively fixing the values of small numbers of variables. The hyperclimbing hypothesis holds that UGAs work by implementing efficient hyperclimbing. Proof of concept for this hypothesis comes from the use of a novel analytic technique involving the exploitation of algorithmic symmetry. We have also obtained experimental results that show that a simple tweak inspired by the hyperclimbing hypothesis dramatically improves the performance of a UGA on large, random instances of MAX-3SAT and the Sherrington Kirkpatrick Spin Glasses problem.},

Cooperation between members of different clans increases with the length of their contests, but decreases when there are more clans.

However, many optimization problems allow for a variable number of components, where the optimal number may not be known a priori. These problems may be solved by using a genetic algorithm that uses a variable-length genome. A particular challenge when using variable-length genomes is the recombination of two parent solutions to produce meaningful children. The performances of several crossover operators are investigated and compared using a sensor placement testbed problem. It is shown that the optimal number of sensors may be determined by each operator, and that performance is improved when care is taken to preserve similarities between parent solutions. Performance may also be further improved by introducing a bias when pairing parents for recombination based on their relative genome lengths.},

Previously implemented to cope with binaries, the suitability of the newly introduced algorithm is investigated in further tasks. Several experiments are run and the results are compared to previous work using the real-valued multiplexer problem. The comparison shows that by implementing the RC technique, real value XCS is capable of producing a compact population of rules through proper generalizations. Moreover, the learning rate of Real-value XCS-RC (RXCS-RC) is comparable or even superior, in some cases.},

In this paper we develop a new preference-based multiobjective optimization algorithm to compete with a previous gradient ascent approach in finding optimal co-clustering ensembles. Unlike the gradient ascent algorithm, our approach once tackles the co-clustering problem with multiple heuristics, then applies the gradient ascent algorithm's joint heuristic as a preference selection procedure. We are able to significantly outperform the gradient ascent algorithm on feature clustering and on problems with smaller datasets.},

A supervisor module determines which of the generated images have been misclassified and which should be added to the training set.

In this study, FOM is investigated as a fitness function in Genetic Programming (GP) for edge detection. Since FOM has some drawbacks from type II errors, new fitness functions are developed based on FOM in order to address these weaknesses. Experimental results show that FOM can be used to evolve GP edge detectors that perform better than the Sobel detector, and the new fitness functions clearly improve the ability of GP edge detectors to find edge points and give a single response on edges, compared with the fitness function using FOM.},

A recently proposed node selection method using size-based tournaments has been shown to have potential, but variations of the method have not been studied systematically. Here we extend the ideas of size-based tournaments and test how they can improve problem-solving performance. We consider allowing tournament size to depend on whether we are selecting nodes within donors for crossover, recipients for crossover, or targets of mutation. We also consider tournaments that bias selection toward smaller trees rather than larger trees. We find that differentiating between donors and recipients is probably not worthwhile and that size 2 tournaments perform near-optimally.},

The goal is to develop predictive tools that estimate how difficult a problemis for GP to solve. Here we consider two groups of methods. We call the first group Evolvability Indicators (EI), measures that capture how amendable the fitness landscape is to a GP search. Examples of EIs are Fitness Distance Correlation (FDC) and Negative Slope Coefficient (NSC). The second group are Predictors of Expected Performance (PEP), models that take as input a set of descriptive attributes of a problem and predict the expected performance of GP. This paper compares an EI, the NSC, and a PEP model for a GP classifier. Results suggest that the EI does not correlate with the performance of the GP classifiers. Conversely, the PEP models show a high correlation with GP performance.},

 abstract = {Evolutionary algorithms with computationally expensive fitness evaluations typically have smaller evaluation budgets and population sizes. However, smaller populations and fewer evaluations mean that the problem space may not be effectively explored. An evolutionary algorithm may be combined with a machine learner to compensate for these smaller populations and evaluations to increase the likelihood of finding viable solutions. Learnable Evolution Model (LEM) is such an evolutionary algorithm (EA) and machine learner (ML) hybrid that infers rules from best- and least-fit individuals and then exploits these rules when creating offspring. This paper shows that LEM introduces a unique form of emergent selection pressure that is separate from any selection pressure induced by parent or survivor selection. Additionally this work shows that this selection pressure can be attenuated by how the best and least fit subsets are chosen, and by how long learned rules are kept. Practitioners need to be aware of this novel form of selection pressure and these means of adjusting it to ensure their LEM implementations are adequately tuned. That is, too much selection pressure may mean premature convergence to inferior solutions while insufficient selection pressure may mean no sufficient solutions are found.},

 abstract = {Dynamic Optimization Problems (DOPs) are a defiance for Genetic Algorithms. In DOPs, a varied number of optima, either local or global, that dynamically change their position and shape in the search space. When applied to DOPs, the standard Genetic Algorithms (SGAs) loose the population diversity. This diversity is necessary for locating multiple optima and for adapting to changes in them. Many researchers have proposed algorithms to enhance the performance of GAs in DOPs. This paper is motivated for applying multimodal optimization technique with a number of remedies to address dynamic optimization problems. First, we use GAs with Dynamic Niche Sharing (GADNS) to maintain diversity in population and to find multiple optima. Second, we perform with an unsupervised fuzzy clustering algorithms to track multiple optima and to overcome some limitations of GADNS. Third, we use a fuzzy system to adjust the population diversity with the mutation and crossover rates. A novel genetic operator inspired by bacterial conjugation is used to improve GAs. A modified tournament selection is used to control the selection pressure. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by using Generalized dynamic benchmark generator (GDBG).},

 abstract = {Crossover is a very important operation in current differential evolution (DE) algorithms. The existing crossover strategies in DE show promising effects especially when the algorithms are applied to separable functions. However, the operation fails to work well when applied to the ill-conditioned and inseparable problems because the recombination of good genes is no longer promising for generating better individuals when the genes are highly correlated. Thus it is possible to use coordinate system rotation strategy which makes the variables be less correlated to improve the performance of the crossover operation. In this paper, we propose to use the principal component analysis (PCA) technique to rebuild a coordinate system. With this system, the correlations among variables are decreased for the crossover operation of DE. In every generation, the population and the mutated population are rotated into the new coordinate system to perform the crossover and then the newly generated population is rotated back to be evaluated. The PCA-based crossover is tested on the JADE algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed method is quite promising on some ill-conditioned and inseparable functions.},

As random walk is an erratic movement that can go in any direction and go to any place, it is likely that this mechanism can be used in search algorithm to bring in diversity. We apply the random walk mechanism into conventional DE variants with different parameters. Experiments are conducted on a set of benchmark functions with different characteristics to demonstrate the advantages of random walk in avoiding local optima. Experimental results show that DE-RWs have general better performance than their corresponding conventional DE variants, especially on multimodal functions.},

 abstract = {The problem of effectively and efficiently finding the global optimum of a function by using evolutionary algorithms is current and pertinent, and two of the evolutionary techniques that have received significant attention in the literature are Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Differential Evolution (DE), as well as their numerous variants. One way of taking advantage of the many good PSO and DE variant algorithms that have appeared in the literature is to run them all for a particular optimization problem and choose the best answer provided. This approach, referred to as the Naive Approach (NA) is time consuming. In this paper, we are using the naive approach with a suite of algorithms for each function minimization problem and we run the algorithms, in the suite, for a specific number of function evaluations (typically much smaller than the number of function evaluations needed for each specific algorithm to converge to a solution) and decide, using appropriate performance measures of merit, which one of these algorithms will continue running until convergence; the rest of the algorithms, deemed as algorithms that will eventually produce inferior solutions, are aborted. We refer to our methodology, for obvious reasons, as the Winner-Take-All (WTA) methodology. Using this methodology we introduce WTA algorithmic variants that are efficient and effective solvers of global optimization problems. In this paper, we report results on one of these variants, called WTA1, and show that it is very competitive compared to the constituent algorithms in the suite used for its design, and efficient compared to NA.},

 abstract = {Methods for evolving robust solutions are necessary when the evolved solutions are algorithms which are deployed in actual consumer products, e.g. Femtocells, low power, low-cost, user-deployed cellular base stations. We compare how multiple and dynamic applications of training scenarios in the evolutionary search produce different solutions and performance on training and test scenarios. For Femtocells, robustness is especially important since each fitness evaluation is a simulation that is computationally expensive. Previous studies in robustness and dynamic environments have not shown differences in the robustness of the solution when a dynamic or multiple setup is used, or if they are negligible. In the dynamic setup the solution gets exposed to a multitude of scenarios during the evolution. Therefore a solution could be evolved which is capable of surviving, and is also more general. The experiments use grammar based Genetic Programming on the Femtocell problem with one grammar for generating real-values and another grammar for generating discrete values for changing the pilot power. The results show that the solutions evolved using multiple scenarios have the best test performance. Moreover, the use of a grammar which produces discrete changes to the pilot power generate better solutions on the training and the test scenarios.},

 abstract = {Interactive Evolutionary Computation (IEC) faces a dilemma between search performance and cost due to user fatigue during solution evaluation. This becomes more serious in the case of real-world problems as they generally require the optimization of both qualitative and quantitative objective functions. Although user preference prediction is a promising way, it requires a certain training data obtained from users. On the other hand, little attention has been given to a search role assignment between a user and system, which essentially should be adjusted according to user's domain knowledge, search progress, etc. Therefore, this paper proposes a method called cooperative evolution by user and system (CEUS), which allows a user to change roles dynamically, and it learns user preferences even from a few user operations, thereby alleviating user fatigue even for problems involving both qualitative and quantitative objective functions. The proposed CEUS is applied to a Japanese anagram generation problem, and experiments in the problem showed that the proposed CEUS allowed a user to dynamically define roles and change operation timing and that it well supports users' convergent and divergent thinking.},

 abstract = {A system to automate the design of passive filters using a multi-objective approach is presented on this work. A fixed but flexible structure is used to code the chromosome representing the circuit topology. An automated procedure is developed to size the circuit components from a given set of specifications. The novelty of this work is the multi-objective approach, where, for one side, priority is given to smaller circuits with less components, but, on the other side it must obey with the performance specifications. The ability of the proposed tool was tested on the design of several filter specifications.},

 abstract = {Though machine learning has been applied to the foreign exchange market for algorithmic trading for quiet some time now, and neural networks(NN) have been shown to yield positive results, in most modern approaches the NN systems are optimized through traditional methods like the backpropagation algorithm for example, and their input signals are price lists, and lists composed of other technical indicator elements. The aim of this paper is twofold: the presentation and testing of the application of topology and weight evolving artificial neural network (TWEANN) systems to automated currency trading, and to demonstrate the performance when using forex chart images as input to geometrical regularity aware indirectly encoded neural network systems, enabling them to use the patterns & trends within, when trading. This paper presents the benchmark results of NN based automated currency trading systems evolved using TWEANNs, and compares the performance and generalization capabilities of these direct encoded NNs which use the standard sliding-window based price vector inputs, and the indirect (substrate) encoded NNs which use charts as input. The TWEANN algorithm I will use in this paper to evolve these currency trading agents is the memetic algorithm based TWEANN system called Deus Ex Neural Network (DXNN) platform.},

 abstract = {Technical analysis uses technical indicators to identify changes in market trend. These are composed by a set of parameters and rules, whose values try to determine the future movements of the assets. This paper addresses the optimization of these values depending on the current market, allowing better returns with less risk. The use of Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) is proposed in this work to obtain the best parameter values in real time belonging to a collection of indicators that will help in the buying and selling of shares. Unlike other previous approaches, the necessity of repeating the parameters optimization process each time a new data enters the system is justified, searching for the best adjustment in every moment. This technique can greatly improve the results of Buy & Hold (B & H) strategy even operating daily. This statement will be demonstrated by comparing the results to those presented in the literature.},

The original formulation for the technique requires analyzing all combinations of candidate projects, which is unfeasible when more than a few alternatives are available. We have used a multiobjective genetic algorithm to partially explore the search space of project combinations and select the most effective ones. We present an experimental study based on four project selection problems that compares the results found by the genetic algorithm to those yielded by a non-systematic search procedure. Results show evidence that the project selection technique can be used in large-scale scenarios and that GA presents better results than simpler search strategy.},

 abstract = {The control parameters in evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have significant effects on the behavior and performance of the algorithm. Most existing parameter control mechanisms are based on either individual fitness or positional distribution of population. This paper proposes a parameter adaptation strategy which aims at evaluating the density distribution of population as well as both the fitness values comprehensively, and adapting the parameters accordingly. The proposed method partitions the individuals into clusters according to their positional distribution. In order to depict the density distribution of population, a variable termed relative cluster density is proposed. Rules are used to modify the values of px and pm based on the relative cluster density and the relative sizes of clusters containing the best and the worst individuals. Experiments are conducted on a set of benchmark functions to investigate the performance and behavior of the proposed method, and the results show that the strategy is promising.},

The evolutionary model produces rules that combine the application of up to six different low-level heuristics during the solution of a given problem instance. Using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method, we visualize in two dimensions all instances characterized by a larger number of features. By over imposing features and hyper-heuristic performance over the 2D graphs, it is possible to draw conclusions about the relation between the bin packing problem structure and the hyper-heuristics performance.},

 abstract = {We introduce a new method for exploratory analysis of large data sets with time-varying features, where the aim is to automatically discover novel relationships between features (over some time period) that are predictive of any of a number of time-varying outcomes (over some other time period). Using a genetic algorithm, we co-evolve (i) a subset of predictive features, (ii) which attribute will be predicted (iii) the time period over which to assess the predictive features, and (iv) the time period over which to assess the predicted attribute. After validating the method on 15 synthetic test problems, we used the approach for exploratory analysis of a large healthcare network data set. We discovered a strong association, with 100percent sensitivity, between hospital participation in multi-institutional quality improvement collaboratives during or before 2002, and changes in the risk-adjusted rates of mortality and morbidity observed after a 1-2 year lag. The results provide indirect evidence that these quality improvement collaboratives may have had the desired effect of improving health care practices at participating hospitals. The proposed approach is a potentially powerful and general tool for exploratory analysis of a wide range of time-series data sets.},
