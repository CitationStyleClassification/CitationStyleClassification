We present a review of current approaches to motif discovery, both evolutionary computation based and otherwise, and a speculative look at the advantages of the evolutionary computation approach and where it might lead us in the future. Particular attention is given to the problem of characterising regulatory DNA motifs and the value of expressive representations for providing accurate classification. },

  abstract = {We discuss a number of fundamental areas in which biologically inspired computing has so far failed to mirror biological reality. These failures make it difficult for those who study biology (and many other scientific fields) to benefit from biologically inspired computing. (1) The apparent impossibility of finding a base level at which to model biological (or most other real-world) phenomena. Although most computer systems are stratified into disjoint and encapsulated levels of abstraction (sometimes known as layered hierarchies), the universe is not.(2) Our inability to characterise on an architectural level the processes that define biological entities in both enough detail and with sufficient abstraction to model them.(3) Our inability to model fitness except in terms of artificially defined functions or artificially defined fitness units. Fitness to an environment is not (a) a measure of an entity's conformance to an ideal, (b) an entity's accumulation of what might be called "fitness points," or even (c) a measure of reproductive success. Fitness to an environment is an entity's ability to acquire and use the resources available in that environment to sustain and perpetuate its life processes.(4) Our inability to build models that allow emergent phenomena to add themselves and their relationships to other phenomena back into our models as first class citizens.These failures arise out of our inability as yet to fully understand what we mean by emergence. As an initial step towards surmounting these hurdles, we attempt to clarify what the problems are and to offer a framework in terms of which we believe they may be understood. We also offer a definition of emergence as the appearance of a process that produces a persistent area of relatively reduced entropy. },

  abstract = {Several general purpose benchmark generators are now available in the literature. They are convenient tools in dynamic continuous optimisation as they can produce test instances with controllable features. Yet, a parallel work in dynamic discrete optimization still lacks. In constructing benchmarks for dynamic combinatorial problems, two issues should be addressed: first, test cases that can effectively test an algorithm ability to adapt can be difficult to create; second, it might be necessary to optimise several instances of an NP-hard problem. Hence, we propose a method for generating benchmarks with known solutions without the need to re-optimize. Consequently, the method does not suffer the usual limitations on the problem size or the sequence length. The paper also proposes a general framework for the generation of test problems. It aims to unify existing approaches and to form a basis for designing newer benchmarks. Such a framework can be more appreciated knowing that combinatorial problems tend to assume very distinct structures, and hence, relevant benchmarks are basically too specific to be of interest to the general reader. },

We indicate how such time-linkage can deceive an optimiser and cause it to find a suboptimal solution trajectory. We then propose a means to address time-linkage:predict the future by learning from the past. We formalise this means in an algorithmic framework. Also, we indicate why evolutionary algorithms are specifically of interest in this framework. We have performed experiments with two new benchmark problems that contain time-linkage. The results show, as a proof of principle,that in the presence of time-linkage EAs based upon this framework can obtain better results than classic EAs that do not predict the future. },

  abstract = {In many real-world design problems, uncertainties are often present and practically impossible to avoid. Many existing works on Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) for handling uncertainty have emphasised on introducing some prior structure of the uncertainty or noise to the variable domain and conducting sensitivity analysis based on the assumed information. we present an evolutionary design optimisation that handles the presence of uncertainty with respect to the desired robust performance in mind, which we call an inverse robust design. The scheme, unlike others developed to represent uncertainty does not assume any structure of the uncertainty involved; hence it is particularly useful when there is very little information about the uncertainties available. In our formulation, we model the clustering of uncertain events in families of nested sets using a multi-level optimization searches within the multi-objective evolutionary search. Empirical studies were conducted on synthetic functions to demonstrate that our algorithm converges to a set of designs with non-dominated nominal performances and robustness to the presence of uncertainties. },

The classical LCS includes two major modules, a genetic algorithm module used to facilitate rule discovery, and a reinforcement learning module used to adjust the strength of the corresponding rules while it receives the rewards from the environment. In LCSE we build a two-level ensemble architecture to enhance the generalisation of LCS. In the first-level, new instances are first bootstrapped and sent to several LCSs for classification. Then, in the second-level, a plurality-vote method is used to combine the classification results of individual LCSs into a final decision. Experiments on some benchmark data sets from the UCI repository have shown that LCSE has better generalisation ability than the single LCS and other supervised learning methods. },

Equally important, however, is the discovery of individual predictors along a continuum of some metric that indicates their association with a particular class.  We report on the use of an XCS learning classifier system for this purpose.  Conducted over a range of odds ratios for a fixed variable in synthetic data, it was found that XCS discovers rules that contain metric information about specific predictors and their relationship to a given class.  In addition, EpiXCS performs qualitatively similarly to See5, and both methods are comparable to logistic regression. },

Particularly we focus our study on UCS, a supervised version of XCS classifier system.  We analyse UCS's behaviour on unbalanced datasets and find that UCS is sensitive to high levels of class imbalance.  We study strategies for dealing with class imbalances, acting either at the sampling level or at the classifier system's level. },

The system, Fox-cs, uses a high level relational language (a subset first order logic) in combination with a $P$-learning technique adapted for Xcs and its derivatives. Fox-cs achieved successful policy transfer in two blocks world tasks, stacking and onab, by learning a policy that was independent of the number of blocks, thus avoiding the prohibitive training times that would normally arise due to the exponential explosion in the number of states as the number of blocks increases. },

Existing interval-based representations still suffer from a few drawbacks which this paper address. we propose an alternative approach called the Min-Percentage representation which produces comparable results to other methods in the literature with the extra advantage of overcoming the drawbacks in these methods. },

  abstract = {Several binary rule encoding schemes have been proposed for Pittsburgh-style classifier systems. We focus on the analysis of how rule encoding may bias the scalability of learning maximally general and accurate rules by classifier systems. The theoretical analysis of maximally general and accurate rules using two different binary rule encoding schemes showed some theoretical results with clear implications to the scalability of any genetic-based machine learning system that uses the studied encoding schemes. Such results are clearly relevant since one of the binary representations studied is widely used on Pittsburgh-style classifier systems, and shows an exponential shrink of the useful rules available as the problem size increases. },

  abstract = {Hyperplane coding is a new, closely related variation of tile coding in which classifier rule conditions fill the role of tiles, and there are few restrictions on the way those ``tiles'' are organised.  The basic idea is to treat rules as features that collectively specify a linear gradient-descent function approximator.  The hypothesis behind this idea is that classifier rules can be more effective as function approximators if they work together to implement a distributed, coarse-coded representation of the value function.  One open question remaining about hyperplane coding is how the quality of the approximation is affected by the set of classifiers in the population.  A random population of classifiers is sufficient to obtain high quality results.  Would a more carefully chosen population do even better?  The obvious next step in this research is to use the approximation resources available in a random population as a starting point for a more refined approach to approximation that reallocates resources adaptively to gain greater precision in those regions of the input space where it is needed.  We show how to compute such an adaptive function approximation. },

Furthermore, the empirical results applying the counter example to LCS verified the results predicted from the theory: (1) LCS with Q-bucket-brigade diverged under the prediction problem, where the action selection policy was fixed; and (2) such divergence was avoided by using implicit-bucket-brigade or applying residual gradient algorithm to Q-bucket-brigade. },

The optimal balance between exploring and exploiting changes as the training progresses due to the increasing amount of learnt knowledge. This shift in balance is not known a priori so an autonomous online adjustment is sought. Human beings manage this balance through logic and explorations based on feedback from the environment. The XCS learning classifier system uses a fixed explore/exploit balance, but does keep multiple statistics about its performance and interaction in an environment. Using these statistics in a non-linear manner, autonomous adjustment of the explore/exploit balance was achieved. This resulted in reduced exploration in simple environments, which could increase with the complexity of the problem domain. It also prevented unsuccessful 'loop' exploit trials and suggests a method of dynamic choice in goal setting. },

The synchronizer develops a set of  alternative plans by solving a multi-objective optimisation problem subject to  several constraints.

  abstract = {Microelectronics are typically critical components in a military platform, some of which may become obsolete, before the equipment life cycle end. Obsolete components may be required for a number of reasons. Components can become obsolete even before production of a platform commences.  The selection of solutions for resolving obsolete components throughout a platform can be considered as a multi-criteria optimisation problem where the aim is to select the most cost effective solutions for resolving a portfolio of obsolescence arisings.  We consider the case where the criteria with which the options are evaluated are not point values, but probability distributions generated by a Bayesian Belief Network. We propose the use of an evaluation technique called measures of effectiveness, that can capture and use the probabilistic information associated with potential solutions. This is used with two candidate optimisation techniques, dynamic programming and evolutionary algorithms, to identify cost effective solutions for resolving obsolescent components throughout a platform. Both optimization techniques were able to identify a number of solutions at different cost and MOE levels for two different scenarios; the solutions that form the DP Pareto front dominate (outperform in terms of cost and benefit) very slightly in places those that form the EA Pareto front.  },

  abstract = {Abstract. We suggest that the relationship between parameter settings, ie parameters controlling mutation, and performance is non-linear in genetic programs. Genetic programming environments have few means for a priori determination of appropriate parameters values.The hypothesised nonlinear behaviour of genetic programming creates difficulty in selecting parameter values for many problems. we study three structure altering mutation techniques using parametric analysis on a problem with scalable complexity. We nd through parameter analysis that two of the three mutation types tested exhibit nonlinear behaviour. Higher mutation rates cause a larger degree of nonlinear behaviour as measured by fitness and computational effort. Characterisation of the mutation techniques using parametric analysis confirms the nonlinear behavior. In addition, we propose an extension to the existing parameter setting taxonomy to include commonly used structure altering mutation attributes. Finally we show that the proportion of mutations applied to internal nodes, instead of leaf nodes, has a significant effect on performance. },

We report three findings. First, the meta-GA can adapt its genetic operators to different problems and thereby perform well on average across diverse problems. Second, the meta-GA can change its parameters during the course of a run - seemingly a good idea - but this behaviour may actually decrease performance. Finally, the genetic operator configurations the meta-GA evolves are far from optimal. We conclude that, while meta-GAs show promise for automating some parameter configurations, they are not likely to replace manually configured genetic and evolutionary algorithms without innovative alteration. },

Artificial 'brains', behaviour strategies, methods of communication, distributed problem solving and many other topics are commonly explored by using genetic algorithms and other evolutionary search techniques. We think that this approach may provide the general guidelines to efficiently manage and "design" computation on large and homogeneous lattices of simple, asynchronously interacting processing elements. Because of their structural simplicity, this kind of substrates will be suitable architectural models for computational machines based on molecular scale devices. We present an environment named Bio-molecular Engine (BME), in which different substrates can be simulated and used as "artificial worlds" where computational entities can rise, grow and evolve. In particular we discuss how to use a grid to evolutionary find a good solution to a well defined design issue: how much parallelism is good for a given problem computed in our environment. },

Increasing a representation's capacity to facilitate effective search, i.e. its evolvability, has long been a goal of Evolutionary Computation. However, currently no benchmarks exist to measure evolvability. One reason is that it is difficult to decouple a representation's capacity to evolve under any fitness function, i.e. the latent evolvability, and its performance on a specific benchmark. Towards this goal, a method is proposed that measures the representation's ability to extract invariant properties from a changing fitness function. The test is applied to three distinct representations and it is able to distinguish all three. Ultimately, this test can serve as the foundation for performing controlled experiments determining what factors contribute to evolvability. },

Often, the novelty of these evolved designs is due to their ability to discover and exploit important principles of the design space, such as the truss and the ratchet. One current obstacle to the real world application of such EDSs is that they often create purely descriptive representations, and are therefore capable of generating designs whose specific assembly is difficult, if not impossible, to infer. One solution that we offer is to evolve how to build, rather than what to build. When evolution occurs in assembly space rather than design space, only buildable objects are produced. Furthermore, as we demonstrate, doing so allows for the emergence not just of novel designs, but of novel means of assembly. },

From this perspective, artificial ontogenies have largely been seen as a vehicle to relate the indirect encodings to complex phenotypes. However, the introduction of a development phase does not come without other consequences. We show that the conjunction of the latent ontogenic structure and the common practice of only evaluating the final phenotype obtained from development can have a net retarding effect on evolution. Using a formal model of development, we show that this effect arises primarily due to the relation between the ontogenic structure to the fitness function, which in turn impacts the properties being evaluated and selected for during evolution. This effect is empirically demonstrated with a toy search problem using LOGO-turtle based embryogenic processes. },

  abstract = {We study the self-organisation of genomic symbols on a genetic algorithm with a location independent representationthe Proportional Genetic Algorithm (PGA) [2]. Self-organisation of genomic symbols is possible because location independent representations ensure the absence of selective pressure for a particular order. We suggest that self-similarity emerges because self-similar genomes are more robust with respect to crossover and mutation and because it favours positive correlations between the form and quality of candidate solutions. The PGA is a Genetic Algorithm (GA) with a representation based on protein concentrations rather than on the usual gene ordering. A PGA translates strings of genes into multisets of proteins prior to fitness evaluation. As a result, there is no fitness pressure for any particular gene ordering and the order of the genes is free to evolve along with the candidate solutions that they encode. Previous studies have shown that genomic symbols under these circumstances are evenly distributed throughout the genome and that they appear to form building blocks of a peculiar type: coarse grained versions of the entire genome. We ask the fundamental questions: what is the emergent genomic ordering when there is no selective pressure for any particular ordering? and why? We use two very different methods to analyse the emergent genomic structure: standard equal symbol correlation analysis, and an experimental method of our own making to analyse the self-similarity of genomic segments with respect to fitness. Our results can be summarised as follows: 1. The equal-symbol correlation on completely location independent genomes, as implemented by the PGA, resembles white noise behaviour and the emergent genomic structure is self-similar with respect to fitness. 2. Emergent genomic self-similarity seems to produce the following effect: it favors positive correlations between form and quality of candidate solutions, a key property needed for stochastic search algorithms such as evolutionary algorithms; and it reduces schemata disruption caused by crossover. },

The development of appropriate feature extraction methods is a tedious effort, particularly because every new classification task requires tailoring the feature set anew. Therefore, the simple building blocks defined in our framework can be combined to complex feature extraction methods. We employ a genetic programming approach guided by the performance of the learning classifier using the new representation. Our approach to evolve representations from series data requires a balance between the completeness of the methods on one side and the tractability of searching for appropriate methods on the other side. Some theoretical considerations illustrate the trade-off. After the feature extraction, a second process learns a classifier from the transformed data. The practical use of the methods is shown by two types of experiments in the domain of music data classification: classification of genres and classification according to user preferences. },

  abstract = {Building effective computational models of living systems requires both a sound conceptual basis and an accurate scheme of implementation. Basic biological principles must be clearly articulated to capture their essential features or logic but not reach beyond legitimate bounds. analyses the relationships among genotype, phenotype, and ontogeny, identifies pitfalls and gaps in these concepts, proposes to abandon the notion of simple mapping of genotype onto phenotype, and integrates them into a more complex, ontologically realistic model of development.  The gene concept in biology embodies two distinct roles, inheritance and development: genes carry traits from one generation to the next and genes encode proteins that specify traits. As vehicles of inheritance genes are entirely passive. However, expression of traits suggests a more active role without specifying what genes do or what they produce.  Resolving this ambiguity must focus on the cellular context in which genes operate during construction of the multicellular body. The phenotype (body) is a complex, highly ordered and temporally defined state, which requires energy to build and maintain. Genes provide templates for proteins necessary for harvesting energy, mediating exchange between a cell and its surroundings, repair, replication, and so forth. According to Harold [1], it is best to regard a cell ' a spatially structured self-organising system made of gene-specified elements. In other words, genes specify the elements but not the system in which the elements operate.  Ontogeny (Gk., onto-, existence, being + -geny, becoming) means literally 'coming into being, constructing the multicellular body.  As development progresses, the organism builds itself, and its phenotype (appearance, traits, organisation, function, etc.) changes rapidly. The modular body plan enables cell-by-cell control of gene expression. Each cell operates in a microenvironment of other cells, the protein meshwork of the extracellular matrix (ECM), and tissue fluids. Cell clusters organise into pockets, cavities or layers as cells divide, grow, change shape, move about, and pull on the fabric of the ECM or adjacent cells to produce an environment suitable for subsequent steps of development. Microenvironments and control of gene expression are the basis for differentiation.Some genes encode a single protein (or RNA molecule). Others encode several proteins (e.g., by alternative splicing), demonstrating that 1:1 mapping of genotype to phenotype is too simplistic. When extrapolated to a genome-wide perspective, genotype is clearly inadequate to specify phenotype, as recent cloning experiments confirm. The relationship between genotype and phenotype in a developing embryo is complex, recursive, and linked to the environment (Figure 1). Phenotype is a higher ontological category than genotype because phenotype includes both the structure and function of components needed to carry out metabolism, communication, replication, repair and other higher order (emergent) properties. Not only is the genotype a representation of a subset of the phenotypic properties, embryonic functions include control of gene expression, which frequently involves signals from other cells, signals not genetically encoded but crucial to survival, growth, and development of the embryo. },

For many kinds of systems this approach can be successful. However, as prescription for building increasingly complex adaptive systems,it often fails. An alternative perspective that is under investigation in our Starcat project suggests that representation is not what drives behaviour but rather what is left over by the system's dynamics after concepts have been activated and behaviour has emerged.There are numerous examples of patterns emerging fromunderlying dynamics. In an ant colony, for example, stigmergicbehavior arises from the colony's dynamics; but when viewedfrom outside the system, the pattern reveals the coupling between colony behaviour and the environment. We could, from that perspective, consider the pheromone and ant trails as a kind of representation. Particles in cellular automata offer another example that demonstrates how coupling with an external environment (here via the fitness function) draws particular behaviour out of the system's dynamics. Again, from an externalperspective, these appear to represent information about theenvironment. Prigogine's dissipative structures describe a similarphenomenon in physical systems far from equilibrium. Thefamiliar Bnard cells could be said to represent a certain level ofheat flow through viscous oil. The dynamic nature of these cellsfurther highlights the likelihood that emergent representationsare very fluid and likely to change as pressure from theenvironment changes. Representation in natural systems maywell be an emergent phenomenon, a consequence of the system'sdynamics, an echo of the coupling between the system's behaviorand the pressures from its environment.There is a family of cognitive architectures, related to Mitchelland Hofstadter's Copycat, which explores these possibilities. TheStarcat project attempts to generalize Copycat, bringing severalapplications under the same design. Starcat is intended toaddress problems in embodied cognition, where the systeminteracts with an environment and must produce behaviorindefinitely, in the face of changing pressures. It is anarchitecture for components that produce and consume codelets.The components swim in a virtual sea of different kinds ofcodelets. The components ignore some codelets and act uponothers, while frequently introducing new ones. Some Starcatcomponents couple to the environment, allowing the supply ofavailable codelets to be regulated externally. Each codelet is ashort-lived agent that may run and then die. Codelets are by theirnature small; and there are many different kinds associated withthe system. The primary job of a codelet is to build up or teardown perceptual structures. So codelet activity leaves an echobehind in the form of transient data structures. These datastructures 'represent Starcat's perceptions and applications ofconcepts.An interesting consequence of Starcat's emergentrepresentation is that the system's myriad micro-behaviors drivethe representation rather than, as in traditional systems,knowledge representation driving behavior. Additionally, thecoordinated aggregate behavior typical of complex adaptivesystemsarising from among the multitudes of interacting localagentsis coupled externally with the environment. In this way,viewed from the outside, the building up and tearing down ofmicrostructures looks like intentional representation.Knowledge representation in Starcat does not capture concepts,nor does it simply get in the way as Brooks has asserted.Representation is what is leftover once concepts have emerged. Itallows the system to be affected by what it is already doing.Once a behavior is done, the representation can erode becausethe representation that had built up to support the recentlycompleted behavior is likely to have parts that are irrelevant tothe next behavior. New representation soon builds up as part ofthe next round of behavior, and the cycle continues.The system experiences pressure from outside, and thispressure changes what the system must do to continue tofunction, even though the specifics of those changes are dictatedentirely by its existing internal dynamics. The environmenttriggers behavior, but it does not specify behavior. This is thenotion of autopoeisis. We suspect that at an importantrelationship exists between autopoeisis, autonomy, and the kindof behaviorally coupled emergent representation that we havebeen describing. Our various applications and correspondingexperiments continue to examine if this is the case.We have developed a simulation of ant colony behavior thatuses a degenerate version of the Starcat architecture. Theexperiments reveal just how much the microbehaviors of anemergent system can produce macroscopic features that arecoupled to the environment. We are about to undertake a newexperiment in which the slipnet plays a shaping role for thecolony. This may be the lynchpin that ties the externalapprehension of representational behavior back into the system.We have an application that will use the perception of patterns inmusical input to shape the ongoing structural changes in theslipnet. We also have a set of agents that are each driven by anindividual slipnet but which interact with one another in acollective workspace. Finally, we are in the process ofreimplementing both Copycat and one of its successors, Madcat,using the Starcat framework. },

The theory developed is a contribution to this project. We first define the simple concept of agenotypic theme and define what it means for mutation operators to be theme preservingand theme altering. We use the idea of theme preservation to develop the concept ofsubrepresentation. Then we develop a theory that illuminates the behavior of amutation-only fitness proportional evolutionary algorithm in which mutation preservesgenotypic themes with high probability. Our theory shows that such evolutionaryalgorithms implicitly implement what we call subrepresentation evolvingmultithreaded evolution, i.e. such EAs conduct second-order search over a predeterminedset of representations and exploit promising representations for first order evolutionarysearch. We illuminate subrepresentaiton evolving multithreaded evolution by comparing andcontrasting it with the behavior of island model EAs. Our theory is immediately useful inunderstanding the significance of the low probability with which theme altering type 2mutations are applied to genotypes of the evolutionary systems in Toussaint's thesis. },

  abstract = {Genetic Programming uses trees to represent chromosomes.  The user defines the representation space by defining the set of functions and terminals to label the nodes in the trees. The sufficiency principle requires that the set be sufficient to label the desired solution trees, often forcing the user to enlarge the set, thus also enlarging the search space. Structure-preserving crossover, STGP, CGP, and CFG-based GP give the user the power to reduce the space by specifying rules for valid tree construction, based on types, syntax, and heuristics. These rules in effect change the representation. However, in general the user may not be aware of the best representation, including heuristics, to solve a particular problem. Last year, ACGP methodology was introduced for extracting local problem-specific heuristics, that is for learning a local model of the problem domain. ACGP discovers representation, in the space of probabilistic representations, one that improves the search itself and that provides the user with heuristics about the domain. We discuss and illustrate the probabilistic representation.  },

For instance, instead of learning a direct probabilistic modelof the dependencies between variables (like BOA does), one canalternatively learn a genetic representation of solutions on whichthese dependencies vanish. We consider questions like: Can everydistribution be induced indirectly by a proper factorialrepresentation? How can such representations be constructed from data?Are specific generative representations, like grammars or L-systems,universal w.r.t. inducing arbitrary distributions?

  abstract = {Least-Squares XCSF is an extension of XCS in which classifier prediction is computed as a linear combination of classifier inputs and a weight vector associated to each classifier. XCSF can adjustthe weight vector of classifiers to evolve accurate piecewiselinear approximations of functions. The Widrow-Hoff rule,used to update the weight vectors, prevents (when someconditions hold) XCSF from exploiting the expected piecewiselinear approximation. We replace theWidrow-Hoff rule with linear least-squares and we show thatwith this improvement XCSF can fully exploit its generalizationcapabilities. },

  abstract = {Evaluating GP schema in context is considered to be a complex,and, at times impossible, task. The tightly linked nodes of a GP tree is the main reason behind its complexity. We present a new approach to evaluate GP schema in context. It is simple in its implementation with a potential to address well-known GP problems, such as identification of significant schema, dead code (introns) and module acquisition to name a few. It is based on the principle that the contribution of a schema can be evaluated by neutralising the effect of the schema in the tree containing it (container-tree) and then checking its effect on the container-tree's fitness. Its usefulness is empirically demonstrated along with its limitation. },

The program will interact with the user via a graphical interface to receive information such as age and gender that is necessary to determine daily nutritional and energy requirements and also information on the preferences of the user among the dishes available. The user will be presented all the dishes and is expected to rate some of them on a scale from 1 to 10. The main goal is to present the user a combination of dishes that satisfies the daily nutritional requirements, minimizes the cost of the daily meal and maximizes the total rating of the meal. In this paper, first the diet problem is going to be introduced, then a genetic algorithm to solve the problem will be presented. },

The organization's genetic code is essentially a policy that specifies the training process for its embedded agents. It also defines the creation of a representative team that is compiled after each organizational time-step. An organization's fitness is based on the performance of this representative team.  },
