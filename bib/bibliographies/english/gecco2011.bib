 abstract = {As biology demonstrates, evolutionary algorithms are an extraordinarily powerful way to design complex nanoscale systems. While we can harness the biological apparatus for replicating and selecting DNA sequences to evolve enzymes and to some extent, organisms, we would like to build replication machinery that would allow us to evolve designs for a much wider variety of materials and systems. Here we describe work that uses techniques from the new field of structural DNA nanotechnology to modularly design nanoscale components that together can be assembled into a system for self-replicating a new form of chemical information or genome, and thus for evolving a new type of chemical sequence.},

In the 1950s, he was one of the first to propose the possibility of implementing genuine living processes in computers and robots. This perspective, while still controversial, is rapidly gaining momentum in many science and engineering communities. Below, we summarise our recent activities to create artificial life from scratch in physicochemical systems. We also outline the nature of the grand science and engineering challenges faced as we seek to realise Von Neumann's vision: Integration of information processing and material production from the nano- to the macroscale in technical systems.},

 abstract = {Particle swarm optimisation (PSO) is an intelligent random search algorithm, and the key to success is to effectively balance between the exploration of the solution space in the early stages and the exploitation of the solution space in the late stages. This paper presents a new dynamic topology called gradually increasing directed neighbourhoods (GIDN) that provides an effective way to balance between exploration and exploitation in the entire iteration process. In our model, each particle begins with a small number of connections and there are many small isolated swarms that improve the exploration ability. At each iteration, we gradually add a number of new connections between particles which improves the ability of exploitation gradually. Furthermore, these connections among particles are created randomly and have directions. We formalise this topology using random graph representations. Experiments are conducted on 31 benchmark test functions to validate our proposed topology. The results show that the PSO with GIDN performs much better than a number of the state of the art algorithms on almost all of the 31 functions.},

We propose an algorithm based on particle swarm optimisation (PSO) to detect continuous and smooth edges in such images. A constrained PSO-based algorithm with a new penalised objective function and two constraints is proposed to overcome noise and reduce broken edges. The new algorithm is examined and compared with a modified version of the Canny algorithm, the robust rank order (RRO)-based algorithm, and an existing PSO-based algorithm on two sets of images with different types and levels of noise. The results suggest that the new algorithm detect edges more accurately than these three algorithms and the detected edges are smoother than those detected by the previous PSO algorithm and thinner than those detected by RRO.},

 abstract = {Standard particle swarm optimisation cannot guarantee convergence to the global optimum in multi-modal search spaces, so multiple swarms can be useful. The multiple swarms all need initial positions and initial velocities for their particles. Several simple strategies to select initial positions and initial velocities are presented. A series of experiments isolates the effects of these selected initial positions and velocities compared to random initial positions and velocities. A first set of experiments shows how locust swarms benefit from scouting for initial positions and the use of initial velocities that launch away from the previous optimum. A second set of experiments show that the performance of WoSP (Waves of Swarm Particles) can be improved by using new search strategies to select the initial positions and initial velocities for the particles in its sub-swarms.},

This problem has historically been addressed ab intra - manipulating velocity and swarm topology - yet the judicious addition of external mechanisms has been shown to adjust search behaviour to yield significantly improved results across many problems. This paper introduces an addition to the canonical particle swarm algorithm, designed to preserve the diversity typically lost by attraction to suboptimal positions. The proposed excited PSO method stimulates exploration upon the discovery of a candidate solution by manipulating the position to which particles are attracted. It is shown to maintain a suitable degree of diversity for the duration of an experiment, as well as an ability for self-scaling. Comparisons to the canonical PSO algorithm demonstrate improved solutions in both unimodal and multimodal spaces.},

This paper presents a multi-objective particle swarm optimisation (MOPSO) algorithm based on a decomposition approach, which is intended for solving continuous and unconstrained multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs). The proposed decomposition-based multi-objective particle swarm optimiser (dMOPSO), updates the position of each particle using a set of solutions considered as the global best according to the decomposition approach. dMOPSO is mainly characterised by the use of a memory reinitialisation process which aims to provide diversity to the swarm. Our proposed approach is compared with respect to two decomposition-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) which are representative of the state-of-the-art in the area. Our results indicate that our proposed approach is competitive and it outperforms the two MOEAs with respect to which it was compared in most of the test problems adopted.},

 abstract = {Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) is an intelligent search method based on swarm intelligence and has been widely used in many fields. However it is also easily trapped in local optima. In order to find a global optimum, some evolutionary search operators used in multi-agent genetic algorithms are integrated into a novel hybrid PSO, with the expectation of effectively escaping from local optima. Particles share their history information and then update their positions using the latest and best history information. Some benchmark high-dimensional functions (from 20 to 10000 dimensions) are used to test the performance of the hybrid algorithms. The results demonstrate that the algorithm can solve high-dimensional nonlinear optimisation problems and that the number of function evaluations required to do so increases with function dimension at a sublinear rate.},

 abstract = {This paper addresses the issue of non-uniform motion deblurring due to hand shake for a single photograph. The main difficulty of spatially variant motion deblurring is that the deconvolution algorithm can not directly be used to estimate the blur kernel as the kernel of different pixels are different to each other. In this paper, the blurred image is considered as a weighed summation of all possible poses, and we proposed to use a PSO (particle swarm optimisation) to optimise the weighed parameters of the corresponding poses after building the motion model of the camera. The main issue of using a PSO for deblurring is that it is generally impossible to obtain the ground true of the observed blurred image, which must be used as the input of the PSO algorithm. To solve this problem, firstly a novel image prediction method is proposed which combines a shock filter and a non-linear structure tensor with anisotropic diffusion. The main advantage of the proposed prediction method is that the deblurring process is not misled by rich texture in the image. Secondly an alternatively optimising procedure is used to gradually refine the motion kernel and the latent image. Experimental results show that our approach makes it possible to model and remove non-uniform motion blur without hardware support.},

 abstract = {The identification of protein binding sites and the prediction of protein-ligand complexes play a key role in the pharmaceutical drug design process and many domains of life sciences. Computational approaches for protein-ligand docking (or molecular docking) have received increased attention over the last years as they allow inexpensive and fast prediction of protein-ligand complexes. Here we introduce the principle of Bee Nest-Site Selection Optimisation (BNSO), which solves optimisation problems using a novel scheme inspired by the nest-site selection behaviour found in honeybees. Moreover, the first BNSO algorithm -- Bee-Nest -- is proposed and applied to molecular docking. The performance of Bee-Nest is tested on 173 docking instances from the PDBbind core set and compared to the performance of three reference algorithms. The results show that Bee-Nest could find ligand poses with very small energy levels. Interestingly, the reference Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) produces results that are qualitatively closer to wet-lab experimentally derived complexes but have higher energy levels than the results found by Bee-Nest. Our results highlight the superior performance of Bee-Nest in semi-local optimization for the molecular docking problem and suggests Bee-Nest's usefulness in a hybrid strategy.},

 abstract = {Honey Bees Mating Optimisation algorithm is a relatively new nature inspired algorithm. In this paper, this nature inspired algorithm is used in a hybrid scheme with other metaheuristic algorithms for successfully solving the Open Vehicle Routing Problem. More precisely, the proposed algorithm for the solution of the Open Vehicle Routing Problem, the Honey Bees Mating Optimization (HBMOOVRP), combines a Honey Bees Mating Optimization (HBMO) algorithm and the Expanding Neighbourhood Search (ENS) algorithm. Two set of benchmark instances is used in order to test the proposed algorithm. The results obtained for both sets are very satisfactory. More specifically, in the fourteen instances proposed by Christofides, the average quality is 0.35percent when a hierarchical objective function is used, where, first, the number of vehicles is minimised and, afterwards, the total travel distance is minimized and the average quality is 0.42percent when only the travel distance is minimized, while for the eight instances proposed by Li et al. when a hierarchical objective function is used the average quality is 0.21percent.},

 abstract = {In recent years, advances in miniaturisation, low-power circuit design, simple, low power, yet reasonably efficient wireless communication equipment, and improved small-scale energy supplies have combined with reduced manufacturing costs to make a new technological vision possible, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). As WSN are still a young research field, much activity is still on-going to solve many open issues. One is the data routing problem. As the size of the network increases, this problem becomes more complex due the amount of sensor nodes in the network. The meta-heuristic Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) has been proposed to solve this issue. ACO based routing algorithms can add a significant contribution to assist in the maximisation of the network lifetime and in the minimisation of the latency in data transmissions, but this is only possible by means of an adaptable and balanced algorithm that takes into account the WSN main restrictions, for example, memory and power supply. A comparison of two ACO based routing algorithms for WSN is presented, taking into account current amounts of energy consumption under a WSN scenario proposed in this work. Furthermore, a new routing algorithm is defined.},

We experiment with Powell's conjugate directions set, Powell's BOBYQA, and Lin-Yu Tseng's Mtsls1 methods as local search procedures. Automatic parameter tuning results show that IACOR-LS with Mtsls1 (IACOR-Mtsls1) is not only a significant improvement over ACOR, but that it is also competitive with the state-of-the-art algorithms described in a recent special issue of the Soft Computing journal. Further experimentation with IACOR-Mtsls1 on an extended benchmark functions suite, which includes functions from both the special issue of Soft Computing and the IEEE 2005 Congress on Evolutionary Computation, demonstrates its good performance on continuous optimisation problems.},

However, traditional DS becomes deficient in multimodal problems, while EAs suffer from long computational time due to the blind search caused by randomness in evolutionary operators. This paper proposes a new derivative-free optimisation algorithm that addresses both the above issues, avoiding prematurity while maintaining fast convergence speed. The new algorithm first estimates basins of attractions in the search space by analysing samples of the objective function. An adaptive exploitation method with the ability to predict promising search directions is then applied to search the estimated basins in parallel. The new algorithm is evaluated on both unimodal and multimodal benchmark functions. Experimental results show that the algorithm is a promising global optimiser with fast convergence speed.},

Given that this problem is of a combinatorial nature and also that the total costs are nonlinear, we propose a hybrid heuristic to solve it. In this type of algorithms one usually tries to manage two conflicting aspects of searching behaviour: exploration, the algorithm's ability to search broadly through the search space; and exploitation, the algorithm ability to search locally around good solutions that have been found previously. In our case, we use an Ant Colony Optimisation algorithm to mainly deal with the exploration, and a Local Search algorithm to cope with the exploitation of the search space. Our method proves to be very efficient while solving both small and large size problem instances. The problems we have used to test the algorithm were previously solved by other authors using other population based heuristics and our algorithm was able to improve upon their results, both in terms of computing time and solution quality.},

In this paper, we generalise and analyse the number of informants that take part in the calculation of new particles.

 abstract = {The selection of parameters in time-delay embedding for phase space reconstruction is crucial to chaotic time series analysis and forecasting. Although various methods have been developed for determining the parameters of embedding dimension and time delay for uniform embedding, the study of parameter selection for non-uniform embedding is progressed at a slow pace. In a non-uniform embedding which enables different dimensions in the phase space to have different time delays, the optimal selection of time delays presents a difficult optimisation problem with combinatorial explosion. To solve this problem, this paper proposes an ant colony optimization (ACO) approach. The advantages of ACO for the embedding parameter selection problem are in two aspects. First, as ACO builds solution in an incremental way, it does not need to use a fixed embedding dimension as the encoding length of a solution. Instead, both the embedding dimension and the time delays can be optimised together. Second, ACO enables the use of problem-based heuristics. Therefore heuristics designed based on the original observed time series can be used to accelerate the search speed of ACO. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is promising.},

 abstract = {Hybrid methods for solving combinatorial optimisation problems have become increasingly popular recently. The present paper is concerned with hybrids of ant colony optimisation and constraint programming which are typically useful for problems with hard constraints. However, the original algorithm suffered from large CPU time requirements. It was shown that such an integration can be made efficient via a further hybridisation with beam search resulting in CP-Beam-ACO. The original work suggested this in the context of job scheduling. We show here that this algorithm type is also effective on another problem class, namely the car sequencing. We consider an optimization version, where we aim to optimise the use rates across the sequence. Car sequencing is a notoriously difficult problem, because it is difficult to obtain good bounds via relaxations. We show that stochastic sampling provides superior results to well known lower bounds for this problem when combined with CP-Beam-ACO.},

We introduce the Embodied Distributed Evolutionary Algorithm (DEA) for on-line, on-board adaptation of robot controllers. We experimentally evaluate DEA using a number of well-known tasks in the evolutionary robotics field to determine whether it is a viable implementation of on-line, on-board evolution. We compare it to the encapsulated mu + 1 ON- LINE algorithm in terms of (the stability of) task performance and the sensitivity to parameter settings.

Experiments show that DEA provides an effective method for on-line, on-board adaptation of robot controllers. Compared to mu + 1 ON- LINE, in terms of performance there is no clear winner, but in terms of sensitivity to parameter settings and stability of performance DEA is significantly better than mu + 1 ON- LINE.},

Recently, it has been shown that changes to the body of a robot may also scaffold the evolution of non trivial behaviour. This raises the question of whether two different kinds of scaffolding (environmental and morphological) synergize with one another when combined. Here it is shown that, for legged robots evolved to perform phototaxis, synergy can be achieved, but only if morphological and environmental scaffolding are combined in a particular way: The robots must first undergo morphological scaffolding, followed by environmental scaffolding. This suggests that additional kinds of scaffolding may create additional synergies that lead to the evolution of increasingly complex robot behaviours.},

 abstract = {In evolutionary robotics, robot controllers are often evolved in a separate development phase preceding actual deployment - we call this off-line evolution. In on-line evolutionary robotics, by contrast, robot controllers adapt through evolution while the robots perform their proper tasks, not in a separate preliminary phase. In this case, individual robots can contain their own self-sufficient evolutionary algorithm (the encapsulated approach) where individuals are typically evaluated by means of a time sharing scheme: an individual is given the run of the robot for some amount of time and fitness corresponds to the robot's task performance in that period.

Racing was originally introduced as a model selection procedure that quickly discards clearly inferior models. We propose and experimentally validate racing as a technique to cut short the evaluation of poor individuals before the regular evaluation period expires. This allows an increase of the number of individuals evaluated per time unit, but it also increases the robot's actual performance by virtue of abandoning controllers that perform inadequately. Our experiments show that racing can improve the performance of robots that adapt their controllers by means of an on-line evolutionary algorithm significantly.},

 abstract = {The challenging scientific field of self-reconfiguring modular robotics (i.e., decentrally controlled 'super-robots' based on autonomous, interacting robot modules with variable morphologies) calls for novel paradigms of designing robot controllers. One option is the approach of evolutionary robotics. In this approach, the challenge is to achieve high evaluation numbers with the available resources which may even affect the feasibility of this approach. Simulations are usually applied at least in a preliminary stage of research to support controller design. However, even simulations are computationally expensive which gets even more burdensome once comprehensive studies and comparisons between different controller designs and approaches have to be done. Hence, a benchmark with low computational cost is needed that still contains the typical challenges of decentral control, is comparable, and easily manageable. We propose such a benchmark and report an empirical study of its characteristics including the transition from the single-robot setting to the multi-robot setting, typical local optima, and properties of adaptive walks through the fitness landscape.},

 abstract = {Foraging strategies in uncertain environments is the subject of a great deal of biological investigation, much of which is grounded in mathematical models. One theoretical prediction with wide empirical support is the ideal free distribution (IFD), where agents distribute themselves among patches of resources in proportion to their suitability. However, the IFD assumes that agents have perfect information of the environment. In nature, this assumption is often violated, yet the IFD is still observed. Insights into evolved mechanisms and behaviours that result in the IFD show how such efficient outcomes may emerge from little information. In this study, the artificial life platform Avida is used to observe populations of digital organisms as they evolved to optimise resource intake in an environment with unpredictable resource distributions. It is shown that the ideal free distribution can emerge from simple foraging strategies that require minimal information. It is demonstrated that this distribution is a result of choices made by the organisms, and not simply due to those in a more advantageous setting producing more offspring. Deviations from the IFD appear to be correlated with reduced information or foraging aggregation. Distributions with organisms of differing abilities are also investigated, demonstrating further correspondence with theoretical predictions.},

 abstract = {An ambitious challenge in artificial life is to craft an evolutionary process that discovers a wide diversity of well-adapted virtual creatures within a single run. Unlike in nature, evolving creatures in virtual worlds tend to converge to a single morphology because selection therein greedily rewards the morphology that is easiest to exploit. However, novelty search, a technique that explicitly rewards diverging, can potentially mitigate such convergence. Thus in this paper an existing creature evolution platform is extended with multi-objective search that balances drives for both novelty and performance. However, there are different ways to combine performance-driven search and novelty search. The suggested approach is to provide evolution with both a novelty objective that encourages diverse morphologies and a local competition objective that rewards individuals outperforming those most similar in morphology. The results in an experiment evolving moving virtual creatures show that novelty search with local competition discovers more functional morphological diversity within a single run than models with global competition, which are more predisposed to converge. The conclusions are that novelty search with local competition may complement recent advances in evolving virtual creatures and may in general be a principled approach to combining novelty search with pressure to achieve.},

 abstract = {Accumulating evidence suggests evolution and ecology can happen on similar time scales. Coevolution between hosts and parasites is a practical example of interacting ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Antagonistic interactions theoretically and experimentally increase host diversity, but the contribution of novel variation to diversity is not well understood. In laboratory or natural settings it is infeasible to prohibit novel mutations in communities while still allowing frequencies of extant organisms to change. We turn to digital organisms to investigate the effects of rapid evolution on host-parasite community diversity in the presence and absence of novel variation. We remove the source of variation in coevolved digital host-parasite communities and allow them to reach an equilibrium. We find that coevolved host-parasite communities are surprisingly stable in the absence of new variation. However, the communities at equilibrium are less diverse than those that continued to experience mutations. In either case, hosts coevolving with parasites are significantly more diverse than hosts evolving alone. Harnessing an advantage of in silico evolution, we show that novel variation increases host diversity in communities with parasites further than the trivial increase expected from new mutations.},

 abstract = {One of the processes by which microorganisms are able to rapidly adapt to changing conditions is horizontal gene transfer, whereby an organism incorporates additional genetic material from sources other than its parent. These genetic elements may encode a wide variety of beneficial traits. Under certain conditions, many computational models capture the evolutionary dynamics of adaptive behaviours such as toxin production, quorum sensing, and biofilm formation, and have even provided new insights into otherwise unknown or misunderstood phenomena. However, such models rarely incorporate horizontal gene transfer, so they may be incapable of fully representing the vast repertoire of behaviors exhibited by natural populations. Although models of horizontal gene transfer exist, they rarely account for the spatial structure of populations, which is often critical to adaptive behaviors.

In this work we develop a spatial model to examine how conjugation, one mechanism of horizontal gene transfer, can be maintained in populations. We investigate how both the costs of transfer and the benefits conferred affect evolutionary outcomes. Further, we examine how rates of transmission evolve, allowing this system to adapt to different environments. Through spatial models such as these, we can gain a greater understanding of the conditions under which horizontally-acquired behaviours are evolved and are maintained.},

 abstract = {Body morphology is thought to have heavily influenced the evolution of neural architecture. However, the extent of this interaction and its underlying principles are largely unclear. To help us elucidate these principles, we examine the artificial evolution of a hypothetical nervous system embedded in a fish-inspired animat. The aim is to observe the evolution of neural structures in relation to both body morphology and required motor primitives. Our investigations reveal that increasing the pressure to evolve a wider range of movements also results in higher levels of neural symmetry. We further examine how different body shapes affect the evolution of neural structure; we find that, in order to achieve optimal movements, the neural structure integrates and compensates for asymmetrical body morphology. Our study clearly indicates that different parts of the animat - specifically, nervous system and body plan - evolve in concert with and become highly functional with respect to the other parts. The autonomous emergence of morphological and neural computation in this model contributes to unveiling the surprisingly strong coupling of such systems in nature.},

 abstract = {Over billions of years, natural selection has continued to select for a framework based on (1) parallelism and (2) cooperation across various levels of organisation within organisms to drive their behaviours and responses. We present a design for a bottom-up, reactive controller where the agent's response emerges from many parallelled, enzymatic interactions (bottom-up) within the biologically-inspired process of signal transduction (reactive). We use enzymes to explore the potential for evolving simulated robot controllers for the central-place foraging problem. The properties of the robot and stimuli present in its environment are encoded in a digital format (molecule) capable of being manipulated and altered through self-contained computational programs (enzymes) executing in parallel inside each controller to produce the robot's foraging behaviour. Evaluation of this design in unbounded worlds reveals evolved strategies employing one or more of the following complex behaviors: (1) swarming, (2) coordinated movement, (3) communication of concepts using a primitive language based on sound and colour, (4) cooperation, and (5) division of labour.},

While a lot of ER works deal with robustness, i.e. the ability to perform well on new contexts close to the ones used for evaluation, no current approach is able to promote broader generalisation abilities without any assumption on the new contexts. In this paper, we introduce the ProGAb approach, which is based on the standard three data sets methodology of supervised machine learning, and compare it to state-of-the-art ER methods on two simulated robotic tasks: a navigation task in a T-maze and a more complex ball-collecting task in an arena. In both applications, the ProGAb approach: (1) produced controllers with better generalisation abilities than the other methods; (2) needed two to three times fewer evaluations to discover such solutions.},

Exploration, in particular, is promoted by specific diversity keeping mechanisms generally relying on the genotype or the fitness value. Recent works suggest that, in the case of Evolutionary Robotics or more generally behavioural system evolution, promoting exploration directly in the behavioural space is of critical importance. In this work an exploration indicator is proposed, based on the sparseness of the population in the behavioural space. This exploration measure is used on two challenging neuro-evolution experiments and validated by showing the dependence of the fitness at the end of the run on the exploration measure during the very first generations. Such a prediction ability could be used to design parameter settings algorithms or selection algorithms dedicated to the evolution of behavioral systems. Several other potential uses of this measure are also proposed and discussed.},

 abstract = {Distributed sensor networks are an attractive area for research in agent systems. This is due primarily to the level of information available in applications where sensing technology has improved dramatically. These include energy systems and area coverage where it is desirable for sensor networks to have the ability to self-organise and be robust to changes in network structure. The challenges presented when investigating distributed sensor networks for such applications include the need for small sensor packages that are still capable of making good decisions to cover areas where multiple types of information may be present. For example in energy systems, singular areas in power plants may produce several types of valuable information, such as temperature, pressure, or chemical indicators.

The approach of the work presented in this paper provides agent fitness functions for use with a neuro-evolutionary algorithm to address some of these challenges. In particular, we show that for self-organisation and robustness to network changes, it is more advantageous to evolve individual policies, rather than a shared policy that all sensor units use. Further, we show that using a difference objective approach to the decomposition of system-level fitness functions provides a better target for evolving these individual policies. This is because the difference evaluation for fitness provides a cleaner signal, while maintaining vital information from the system level that implicitly promotes coordination among individual sensor units in the network.},

For a particular set of structures, we search the space of quality functions using Genetic Programming, to find a function that locally describes that set of structures. This technique allows us to investigate the common network properties of defined sets of structures. We also use this technique to classify and differentiate between different types of structure. We apply this method on several synthetic benchmarks, and on a protein-protein interaction network. Our results indicate this is a useful technique of investigating properties that sets of network structures have in common.},

 abstract = {The discovery of the structure of genetic regulatory networks is of great interest for biologists and geneticists due to its pivotal role in organisms' metabolism. In the present paper we aim to investigate the inference power of genetic regulatory networks modelled as random Boolean networks without the use of any prior biological information. The solutions space is explored by means of genetic algorithms, whose main goal is to find a consistent network given the target data obtained from biological experiments. We show that this approach succeeds in reconstructing a model with satisfactory level of accuracy, representing an useful tool to guide biologist towards the most probable interactions between the target genes.},

 abstract = {Applying grammatical evolution to evolve neural networks (GENN) has been increasing used in genetic epidemiology to detect gene-gene or gene-environment interactions, also known as epistasis, in high dimensional data. GENN approaches have previously been shown to be highly successful in a range of simulated and real case-control studies, and has recently been applied to quantitative traits. In the current study, we evaluate the potential of an application of GENN to quantitative traits (QTGENN) to a range of simulated genetic models. We demonstrate the power of the approach, and compare this power to more traditional linear regression analysis approaches. We find that the QTGENN approach has relatively high power to detect both single-locus models as well as several completely epistatic two-locus models, and favourably compares to the regression methods.},

 abstract = {Many systems, particularly in biology and chemistry, involve the interaction of discrete quantities, such as individual elements or molecules. When the total number of elements in the system is low, the impact of individual reactions becomes non-negligible and modelling requires the simulation of exact sequences of reactions. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm that can infer an exact stochastic reaction model based on sparse measurements of an evolving system of discrete quantities. The algorithm is based on simulating a candidate model to maximise the likelihood of the data. When the likelihood is too small to provide a search gradient, the algorithm uses the distance of the data to the model's estimated distribution. Results show that this method infers stochastic models reliably with both short time gaps between measurements of the system, and long time gaps where the system state has evolved qualitatively far between each measurement. Furthermore, the proposed metric outperforms optimising on likelihood or distance components alone. Traits measured on the search novelty, age, and bloat suggest that this algorithm scales well to increasingly complex systems.},

This paper presents two extensions of recently proposed evolutionary-based iterative local search algorithm called POEMS for solving the SCS problem. Both extensions improve scalability of the algorithm. The first one improves the efficiency of the evaluation procedure and the second one further improves optimization capabilities of the algorithm by intensifying the search towards short supersequence already during the process of constructing the valid supersequence. A moderate size benchmark was used for the proof-of-concept experiments while two very large biological benchmarks were used to demonstrate the capability of the proposed approach. The proposed algorithm performs very well on all of the benchmarks. Moreover, it produces significantly better solutions than the baseline Deposition and Reduction algorithm on the two challenging large benchmarks.},

AP is an efficient clustering algorithm based on message-passing methods and which automatically identifies exemplars of each cluster. We introduce an EDA-based procedure to compute the preferences used by the AP algorithm. Our results show that AP performance can be notably improved by using the introduced approach. Furthermore, we present evidence that classification of new data is improved by employing previously identified exemplars with only minor decrease in classification accuracy.},

 abstract = {In this paper we propose a novel representation scheme, called probabilistic encoding. In this representation, each gene of an individual represents the probability that a certain trait of a given problem has to belong to the solution. This allows to deal with uncertainty that can be present in an optimisation problem, and grant more exploration capability to an evolutionary algorithm. With this encoding, the search is not restricted to points of the search space. Instead, whole regions are searched, with the aim of individuating a promising region, i.e., a region that contains the optimal solution. This implies that a strategy for searching the individuated region has to be adopted. In this paper we incorporate the probabilistic encoding into a multi-objective and multi-modal evolutionary algorithm. The algorithm returns a promising region, which is then searched by using simulated annealing. We apply our proposal to the problem of discovering biclusters in microarray data. Results confirm the validity of our proposal.},

Therefore, methods which could predict the TMHs topologies computationally are highly desired. In this paper we introduce TMHindex, a method for detecting TMH segments solely by the amino acid sequence information. Each amino acid in a protein sequence is represented by a Compositional Index deduced from a combination of the difference in amino acid appearances in TMH and non-TMH segments in training protein sequences and the amino acid composition information. Furthermore, genetic algorithm was employed to find the optimal threshold value to separate TMH segments from non-TMH segments. The method successfully predicted 376 out of the 378 TMH segments in 70 testing protein sequences. The level of accuracy achieved using TMHindex in comparison to recent methods for predicting the topology of TM proteins is a strong argument in favour of our method.},

We outline a prototype for the generation of in-game terrain by compiling smaller height-map patches that have been extracted from sample maps. Evolutionary algorithms are applied to this generation process by using crossover and mutation to evolve the layout of the patches. This paper demonstrates the benefits of an interactive two-level parent selection mechanism as well as how to seamlessly stitch patches of terrain together. This unique patch-based terrain model enhances control over the evolution process, allowing for terrain to be refined more intuitively to meet the user's expectations.},

Which of these methods work best, and do they outperform human design and machine design alone? In order to answer this question, a human-subject experiment for comparing human-assisted machine learning methods was conducted. Three different approaches, i.e. advice, shaping, and demonstration, were employed to assist a powerful machine learning technique (neuroevolution) on a collection of agent training tasks, and contrasted with both a completely manual approach (scripting) and a completely hands-off one (neuroevolution alone). The results show that, (1) human-assisted evolution outperforms a manual scripting approach, (2) unassisted evolution performs consistently well across domains, and (3) different methods of assisting neuroevolution outperform unassisted evolution on different tasks. If done right, human-assisted neuroevolution can therefore be a powerful technique for constructing intelligent agents.},

 abstract = {Abstract Game-tree search is the engine behind many computer game opponents. Traditional game-tree search algorithms decide which move to make based on simulating actions, evaluating future board states, and then applying the evaluations to estimate optimal play by all players. Yet the limiting factor of such algorithms is that the search space increases exponentially with the number of actions taken (i.e. the depth of the search). More recent research in game-tree search has revealed that even more important than evaluating future board states is effective pruning of the search space. Accordingly, this paper discusses Geometric Game-Tree Pruning (GGTP), a novel evolutionary method that learns to prune game trees based on geometric properties of the game board. The experiment compares Cake, a minimax-based game-tree search algorithm, with HyperNEAT-Cake, the original Cake algorithm combined with an indirectly encoded, evolved GGTP algorithm. The results show that HyperNEAT-Cake wins significantly more games than regular Cake playing against itself.},

 abstract = {While the real-time focus of today's automated accompaniment generators can benefit instrumentalists and vocalists in their practice, improvisation, or performance, an opportunity remains specifically to assist novice composers. This paper introduces a novel such approach based on evolutionary computation called functional scaffolding for musical composition (FSMC), which helps the user explore potential accompaniments for existing musical pieces, or scaffolds. The key idea is to produce accompaniment as a function of the scaffold, thereby inheriting from its inherent style and texture. To implement this idea, accompaniments are represented by a special type of neural network called a compositional pattern producing network (CPPN), which produces harmonies by elaborating on and exploiting regularities in pitches and rhythms found in the scaffold. This paper focuses on how inexperienced composers can personalise accompaniments by first choosing any MIDI scaffold, then selecting which parts (e.g. the piano, guitar, or bass guitar) the CPPN can hear, and finally customising and refining the computer-generated accompaniment through an interactive process of selection and mutation of CPPNs called interactive evolutionary computation (IEC). The potential of this approach is demonstrated by following the evolution of a specific accompaniment and studying whether listeners appreciate the results.},

 abstract = {We present a framework for the procedural generation of tracks for a high-end car racing game (TORCS) using interactive evolution. The framework maintains multiple populations and allow users to work both on their own population (in single-user mode) or to collaborate with other users on a shared population. Our architecture comprises a web frontend and an evolutionary backend. The former manages the interaction with users (e.g., logs registered and anonymous users, collects evaluations, provides access to all the evolved populations) and maintains the database server that stores all the present/past populations. The latter runs all the tasks related to evolution (selection, recombination and mutation) and all the tasks related to the target racing game (e.g., the track generation). We performed two sets of experiments involving five human subjects to evolve racing tracks alone (in a single-user mode) or cooperatively. Our preliminary results on five human subjects show that, in all the experiments, there is an increase of users' satisfaction as the evolution proceeds. Users stated that they perceived improvements in the quality of the individuals between subsequent populations and that, at the end, the process produced interesting tracks.},

 abstract = {We focus on a representation for evolutionary music based on executable graphs in which nodes execute arithmetic functions. Input nodes supply time variables and abstract control variables, and multiple output nodes are mapped to MIDI data. The motivation is that multiple outputs from a single graph should tend to behave in related ways, a key characteristic of good music. While the graph itself determines the short-term behaviour of the music, the control variables can be used to specify large-scale musical structure. This separation of music into form and content enables novel compositional techniques well-suited to writing for games and film, as well as for standalone pieces. A mapping from integer-array genotypes to executable graph phenotypes means that evolution, both interactive and non-interactive, can be applied. Experiments with and without human listeners support several specific claims concerning the system's benefits.},

 abstract = {Feature selection is an important prerequisite for music classification which in turn is becoming more and more ubiquitous since entering the digital music age. Automated classification into genres or even personal categories is currently envisioned even for standard mobile devices. However, classifiers often fail to work well with all available features, and simple greedy methods often fail to select good feature sets, making feature selection for music classification a natural field of application for evolutionary approaches in general, and multi-objective evolutionary algorithms in particular. In this work, we study the potential of applying such a multi-objective evolutionary optimisation algorithm for feature selection with different objective sets. The result is promising, thus calling for deeper investigations of this approach.},

 abstract = {One of the greatest problems when using genetic algorithms to evolve melodies is creating an aesthetically conscious measure of fitness. In this paper, we describe a new approach with a minimum measure of fitness in which a set of good individuals is returned at the end of the process. Details about the implementation of a population of measures and some genetic operators are described in this work before an implicit way to evaluate fitness is given. We define a Takeover Matrix to measure the relationship between different generations and its compromise between originality and diversity. By means of this Takeover Matrix, the evolutionary process itself can be used as a criterion instead of using only ordinary individual measures of fitness. The results show the implications of using the proposed approach and demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is able to generate good sets of melodies. The algorithm can be used not only for developing new ideas but also to extend earlier created melodies with influence from the initial population.},

In this paper, we develop and study the performance of a  algorithm, designed to solve a variant of the course timetabling problem. Our aim here is twofold: to develop a competitive algorithm, and to investigate, more generally, the applicability of evolutionary algorithms to timetabling. To this end, an algorithm is first introduced and tested using a benchmark set. Comparison with other algorithms shows that our algorithm achieves better results in some, but not all instances, signifying strong and weak points. Subsequently, more comprehensive analyses are performed in relation with another evolutionary algorithm that uses strictly group-based operators. Ultimately, empirical results and analyses lead us to question the exclusive use of group-based evolutionary operators for timetabling problems.},

This problem has been proposed recently on the literature and since then a couple of metaheuristics have been used to address it. The one proposed here, called GTS, consists of two phases: initially, some solutions are generated by the GRASP metaheuristic; subsequently, the Tabu Search (TS) is applied in the best solution found by GRASP. The numerical experiments show that the GTS heuristic was able to improve the results in 70percent (251 out of 360) of the larger instances available in the literature.},

 abstract = {A Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) is a powerful framework for representing and solving constraint problems. When solving a CSP using a backtrack search method, one important factor that reduces the size of the search space drastically is the order in which variables and values are examined. Many heuristics for static and dynamic variable ordering have been proposed and the most popular and powerful are those that gather information about the failures during the constraint propagation phase, in the form of constraint weights. These later heuristics are called conflict driven heuristics. In this paper, we propose two of these heuristics respectively based on Hill Climbing (HC) and Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) for weighing constraints. In addition, we propose two new value ordering techniques, respectively based on HC and ACO, that rank the values based on their ability to satisfy the constraints attached to their corresponding variables. Several experiments were conducted on various types of problems including random, quasi random and patterned problems. The results show that the proposed variable ordering heuristics, are successful especially in the case of hard random problems. Also, when using the proposed value and variable ordering together, we can improve the performance particularly in the case of random problems.},

 abstract = {In this paper, two new metaheuristic algorithms for the graph colouring problem are introduced. The first one is a population-based multiagent evolutionary algorithm (MEA), using a multiagent system, where an agent represents a tabu search procedure. Rather than using a single long-term local search procedure, it uses more agents representing short term local search procedures. Instead of a specific crossover, MEA uses relatively general mechanisms from artificial life, such as lifespans and elite list [3, 4]. We are introducing and investigating a new parametrisation system, along with a mechanism of reward and punishment for agents according to change in their fitness. The second algorithm is a pseudo-reactive tabu search (PRTS), introducing a new online learning strategy to balance its own parameter settings. Basically, it is inspired by the idea to learn tabu tenure parameters instead of using constants. Both algorithms empirically outperform basic tabu search algorithm TabuCol [8] on the well-established DIMACS instances [10]. However, they achieve this by using different strategies. This indeed shows a difference in potential of population-based and learning-based graph coloring metaheuristics.},

 abstract = {The generalised travelling salesman problem (GTSP) is an NP-hard problem that extends the classical travelling salesman problem by partitioning the nodes into clusters and looking for a minimum Hamiltonian tour visiting exactly one node from each cluster. In this paper, we combine the consultant-guided search technique with a local-global approach in order to solve efficiently the generalised traveling salesman problem. We use candidate lists in order to reduce the search space and we introduce efficient variants of 2-opt and 3-opt local search in order to improve the solutions. The resulting algorithm is applied to Euclidean GTSP instances derived from the TSPLIB library. The experimental results show that our algorithm is able to compete with the best existing algorithms in terms of solution quality and running time.},

 abstract = {This work introduces a new crossover operator specially designed to be used in genetic algorithms (GAs) that encode candidate solutions as sets of fixed cardinality. The Transmitting Random Assortment Recombination (TransRAR) operator proceeds by taking elements from a multiset, which is built by the union of the parent chromosomes, allowing repeated elements. If an element that is present in both parents is drawn, it is accepted with probability 1. Elements that belong to only one of the parents are accepted with a probability p, smaller than 1. The performance of this novel crossover operator is assessed in synthetic and real-world problems. In these problems, GAs that employ this type of crossover outperform those that use alternative operators for sets, such as Random Assortment Recombination (RAR), Random Respectful Recombination (R3) or Random Transmitting Recombination (RTR). Furthermore, TransRAR can be implemented very efficiently and is faster than RAR, its closest competitor in terms of overall performance.},

 abstract = {Handling Multiobjective Optimisation Problems (MOOP) using Hybrid Metaheuristics represents a promising and interest area of research. In this paper, a Hybrid Evolutionary Metaheuristics (HEMH) is presented. It combines different metaheuristics integrated with each other to enhance the search capabilities. It improves both of intensification and diversification toward the preferred solutions and concentrates the search efforts to investigate the promising regions in the search space. In the proposed HEMH, the search process is divided into two phases. In the first one, the DM-GRASP is applied to obtain an initial set of high quality solutions dispersed along the Pareto front. Then, the search efforts are intensified on the promising regions around these solutions through the second phase. The greedy randomised path-relinking with local search or reproduction operators are applied to improve the quality and to guide the search to explore the non discovered regions in the search space. The two phases are combined with a suitable evolutionary framework supporting the integration and cooperation. Moreover, the efficient solutions explored over the search are collected in an external archive. The HEMH is verified and tested against some of the state of the art MOEAs using a set of MOKSP instances commonly used in the literature. The experimental results indicate that the HEMH is highly competitive and can be considered as a viable alternative.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a hyper GA system to evolve optimal agendas for package deal negotiation. The proposed system uses a Surrogate Model based on Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFNs) to speed up the evolution. The negotiation scenario is as follows. There are two negotiators/agents (a and b) and m issues/items available for negotiation. But from these m issues, the agents must choose g issues and negotiate on them. The g issues thus chosen form the agenda. The agenda is important because the outcome of negotiation depends on it. Furthermore, a and b will, in general, get different utilities/profits from different agendas. Thus, for competitive negotiation (i.e., negotiation where each agent wants to maximise its own utility), each agent wants to choose an agenda that maximizes its own profit. However, the problem of determining an agent's optimal agenda is complex, as it requires combinatorial search. To overcome this problem, we present a hyper GA method that uses a Surrogate Model based on Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFNs) to find an agent's optimal agenda. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated experimentally. The results of these experiments demonstrate that the surrogate assisted algorithm, on average, performs better than standard GA and random search.},

 abstract = {The issue addressed in this paper is how to build low-level hybrid cooperative optimisation methods that combine a Genetic Algorithm (GA) with a Branch-and-Bound algorithm (B&B). The key challenge is to provide a common solution and search space coding and associated transformation operators enabling an efficient cooperation between the two algorithms. The tree-based coding is traditionally used in exact optimisation methods such as B&B. In this paper, we explore the idea of using such coding in Genetic Algorithms. Following this idea, we propose a pioneering approach hybridising a GA with a B&B algorithm. The information (solutions and search sub-spaces) exchange between the two algorithms is performed at low-level and during the exploration process. From the implementation point of view, the common coding has facilitated the low-level coupling of two software frameworks: ParadisEO and BOB++ used to implement respectively the GA and the B&B algorithms. The proposed approach has been experimented on the 3D Quadratic Assignment Problem. In order to support the CPU cost of the hybridisation mechanism, hierarchical parallel computing is used together with grid computing.},

The GCP consists in finding the minimum number of colours for colouring the graph vertices such that adjacent vertices have distinct colors. We propose a parallel approach based on Hierarchical Parallel Genetic Algorithms (HPGAs) to solve the GCP. We also propose a new extension to PGA, that is Genetic Modification (GM) operator designed for solving constraint optimisation problems by taking advantage of the properties between variables and their relations. Our proposed GM for solving the GCP is based on a novel Variable Ordering Algorithm (VOA). In order to evaluate the performance of our new approach, we have conducted several experiments on GCP instances taken from the well known DIMACS website. The results show that the proposed approach has a high performance in time and quality of the solution returned in solving graph coloring instances taken from DIMACS website. The quality of the solution is measured here by comparing the returned solution with the optimal one.},

Previous work has also shown that partial neighborhoods may exist that retain some properties characteristic of elementary landscapes. For a tour of n cities, we show that the 2-opt neighbourhood can be decomposed into n/2-1 partial neighborhoods. While this paper focuses on the TSP, it also introduces a more formal treatment of partial neighborhoods which applies to all elementary landscapes. Tracking partial neighborhood averages in elementary landscapes requires partitioning the cost matrix. After every move in the search space, the relevant partitions must be updated. However, just as the evaluation function allows a partial update for the TSP, there also exists a partial update for the cost matrix partitions. By only looking at a subset of the partial neighborhoods we can further reduce the cost of updating the cost matrix partitions.},

 abstract = {We have recently proposed a Population-based Guided Local Search (P-GLS) framework for solving difficult combinatorial optimisation problems. In P-GLS, several agents of guided local search (GLS) procedures are run in a parallel way. These agents exchange information acquired from their previous search to make their further search more rational. We suggested based on the well-known proximate optimality principle (POP) that the shared features between the current agents' local optimal solutions are more likely to be part of the best solution to the problem; therefore these features should not be penalised. However, sometimes some of these common features may not exhibit in a global optimal solution. In this paper, a new framework is proposed to improve the performance as well as overcome the limitations in P-GLS. It applies two new different penalisation strategies that increase favouring common features based on their occurrences in the agents' local optimal solutions during the search. The performance of the new algorithm, examined on the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), is investigated and evaluated in terms of solution quality and the speed. The experimental results demonstrate that the new algorithm outperforms the parallel GLS algorithm without collaboration and other state-of-the-art algorithms.},

This work presents a harmony search with differential mutation based pitch adjustment (HSDM) algorithm, which improves the original pitch adjustment operator of HS using the self-referential differential mutation scheme that features differential evolution - another celebrated metaheuristic algorithm. In HSDM, the differential mutation based pitch adjustment can dynamically adapt the properties of the landscapes being explored at different searching stages. Meanwhile, the pitch adjustment operator's execution probability is allowed to vary randomly between 0 and 1, which can maintain both wild and fine exploitation throughout the searching course. HSDM has been evaluated and compared to the original HS and two recent HS variants using 16 numerical test problems of various searching landscape complexities at 10 and 30 dimensions. HSDM almost always demonstrates superiority on all test problems.},

 abstract = {Baldwinian evolution is a type of hybridisation of population-based global search and individual local search. The individuals take local refining processes, then in selection benefit from the improved fitness, but do not pass on the refined traits the data in to the offspring. The lost information of the refined phenotype implies that the inheritance encoded in genotypes is not directly benefit traits, but the traits having potential to achieve high fitness through the lifetime interaction with the environment. As the result, it is necessary to study how learning works comparing to the previous generation, in addition to how much it improves on the current population. The children may imitate what their parents performed and catch up with them, or alternatively, explore elsewhere and have no idea of where the parents arrived. In this paper, the trade-off is investigated, and it is revealed that in Baldwinian learning, the capability to follow the parents' footprints benefits. With higher imitation tendency, the evolving population can maintain a greater scale of learning potential, and the search results in better speed and convergence.},

This study introduces a novel method of parameter control, i.e. the dynamic and automated variation of values for parameters used in approximate algorithms. The method uses an evaluation of the recent performance of previously applied parameter values and predicts how likely each of the parameter values is to produce optimal outcomes in the next cycle of the algorithm. The resulting probability distribution is used to determine the parameter values for the following cycle. The results of our experiments show a consistently superior performance of two very different EA algorithms when they are parameterised using the predictive parameter control method.},

This paper introduces a real-valued characteristic function to illustrate this property of fuzziness. We examine all the possible binary models and real-valued models on a test problem. The results show that the optimal real-valued model is better than all the binary models. This paper also proposes a crossover method which is able to use the real-valued information. Experiments show that the proposed crossover could reduce the number of function evaluations up to four times. Moreover, this paper proposes an effective method to find a threshold for entropy based interaction-detection metric and a method to learn real-valued models. Experiments show that the proposed crossover with the learnt real-valued models works well.},

 abstract = {A simple parameter-less local optimiser able to solve deterministic problems with building blocks of bounded order is proposed in this article. The algorithm is able to learn and use linkage information during the run. The algorithm is algorithmically simple, easy to implement and with the exception of termination condition, it is completely parameter-free---there is thus no need to tune the population size and other parameters to the problem at hand. An empirical comparison on 3 decomposable functions, each with uniformly scaled building blocks of size 5 and 8, was carried out. The algorithm exhibits quadratic scaling with the problem dimensionality, but the comparison with the extended compact genetic algorithm and Bayesian optimisation algorithm shows that it needs lower or comparable number of fitness function evaluations on the majority of functions for the tested problem dimensionalities. The results also suggest that the efficiency of the local optimizer compared to both the estimation-of-distribution algorithms should be better for problem sizes under at least a few hundreds of bits.},

In this paper we investigate the use of regularisation as a way to approximate k-order Markov models when $k$ is increased. The introduced regularised models are used to balance the complexity and accuracy of the k-order Markov models. We investigate the behaviour of the EDAs in several instances of the hydrophobic-polar (HP) protein problem, a simplified protein folding model. Our preliminary results show that EDAs that use regularized approximations of the k-order Markov models offer a good compromise between complexity and efficiency, and could be an appropriate choice when the number of variables is increased.},

This work was studied in a recent graph-based EDA named Probabilistic Model Building Genetic Network Programming (PMBGNP) which can solve RL problems successfully.

 abstract = {Estimation of Distribution Algorithms are a class of evolutionary algorithms characterised by the use of probabilistic models. These algorithms have been applied successfully to a wide set of artificial and real-world problems, achieving competitive results in most scenarios. Nevertheless, there are some problems whose solutions can be naturally represented as a permutation, for which EDAs have not been extensively developed. Although some work has been done in this area, most of the approaches are adaptations of EDAs designed for problems based on integer or real domains, and only a few algorithms have been specifically designed to deal with permutation-based problems. In this paper, we present an EDA that learns probability distributions over permutations. Particularly, our approach is based on the use of k-order marginals. In addition, we carry out some preliminary experiments over classical permutation-based problems in order to study the performance of the proposed k-order marginals EDA.},

One of the reasons for this is that most problem difficulty measures are based on neighbourhood structures that are quite different from those used in most evolutionary algorithms. This paper examines several ways to increase the accuracy of problem difficulty measures by including linkage information in the measure to more accurately take into account the advanced neighborhoods explored by some evolutionary algorithms. The effects of these modifications of problem difficulty are examined in the context of several simple and advanced evolutionary algorithms. The results are then discussed and promising areas for future research are proposed.},

But often, it might also be useful to obtain a set of structurally very diverse solutions which all have acceptable objective values. With such a set, a decision maker would be given a choice of solutions to select from. In addition, he can learn about the optimisation problem at hand by inspecting the diverse close-to-optimal solutions. This paper proposes NOAH, an evolutionary algorithm which solves a mixed multi-objective problem: Determine a maximally diverse set of solutions whose objective values are below a provided objective barrier. It does so by iteratively switching between objective value and set-diversity optimization while automatically adapting a constraint on the objective value until it reaches the barrier. Tests on an nk-Landscapes problem and a 3-Sat problem as well as on a more realistic bridge construction problem show that the algorithm is able to produce high quality solutions with a significantly higher structural diversity than standard evolutionary algorithms.},

 abstract = {Recently distance minimisation problems in a two-dimensional decision space have been used as many-objective test problems to visually examine the behaviour of evolutionary multi-objective optimisation (EMO) algorithms. Such a test problem is usually defined by a single polygon where the distance from a solution to each vertex is minimised in the decision space. We can easily generate different test problems from different polygons. We can also easily generate test problems with multiple equivalent Pareto optimal regions using multiple polygons of the same shape and the same size. Whereas these test problems have a number of advantages, they have no clear relevance to real-world situations since they are artificially generated unrealistic test problems. In this paper, we generate a distance minimisation problem from a real-world map. Our test problem has four objectives, which are to minimise the distances to the nearest elementary school, junior high school, railway station, and convenience store. Using our test problem, we examine the behaviour of well-known and frequently-used EMO algorithms in terms of their diversity maintenance ability in the two-dimensional decision space.},

 abstract = {A new Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA) based on Differential Evolution (DE), i.e., Indicator-Based DE (IBDE) is proposed. IBDE employs a strategy of DE for generating a series of offspring. In order to evaluate the quality of each individual in the population, IBDE uses the exclusive hypervolume as an indicator function. A fast algorithm called Incremental Hypervolume by Slicing Objectives (IHSO) has been reported for calculating the exclusive hypervolume. However, the computational time spent by IHSO increases exponentially with the number of objectives and considered individuals. Therefore, an exclusive hypervolume approximation, in which IHSO can be also used effectively, is proposed. Furthermore, it is proved that the proposed exclusive hypervolume approximation gives an upper bound of the accurate exclusive hypervolume. The procedure of IHSO is parallelled by using the multiple threads of the Java language. By using the parallelled IHSO, not only the exclusive hypervolume but also the exclusive hypervolume approximation can be calculated concurrently on a multi-core processor. By the results of numerical experiments and statistical tests conducted on test problems, the usefulness of the proposed approach is demonstrated.},

Applying differential evolution (DE) to MOPs is a promising research topic and has drawn a lot of attention in recent years. To search high-quality solutions for MOPs, this paper presents a robust adaptive DE (termed AS-MODE) with following two features. First, a stochastic coding strategy is used to improve the solution quality. This coding strategy represents each individual by a stochastic region, which enables the algorithm to fine-tune solutions efficiently. Second, a probability-based adaptive control strategy is used to reduce the influence of parameter settings. The adaptive control strategy associates each parameter with a candidate value set. Better candidate values would have higher selection probabilities to generate new individuals. The performance of the proposed AS-MODE is compared with several highly regarded multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. Simulation results on ten benchmark test functions with different characteristics reveal that AS-MODE yields very promising performance.},

 abstract = {Differential evolution (DE) has been traditionally applied to solving benchmark continuous optimisation functions. To enable it to solve a combinatorially oriented design problem, such as the construction of effective radio frequency identification antennas, requires the development of a suitable encoding of the discrete decision variables in a continuous space. This study introduces an encoding that allows the algorithm to construct antennas of varying complexity and length. The DE algorithm developed is a multiobjective approach that maximises antenna efficiency and minimises resonant frequency. Its results are compared with those generated by a family of ant colony optimisation (ACO) metaheuristics that have formed the standard in this area. Results indicate that DE can work well on this problem and that the proposed solution encoding is suitable. On small antenna grid sizes (hence, smaller solution spaces) DE performs well in comparison to ACO, while as the solution space increases its relative performance decreases. However, as the ACO employs a local search operator that the DE currently does not, there is scope for further improvement to the DE approach.},

 abstract = {A lot of optimal and heuristic algorithms for solving facility layout problem (FLP) have been developed in the past few decades. The majority of these approaches adopt a problem formulation known as the quadratic assignment problem (QAP) that is particularly suitable for equal area facilities. Unequal area FLP comprises a class of extremely difficult and widely applicable optimisation problems arising in many diverse areas to meet the requirements for real-world applications. Unfortunately, most of these approaches are based on a single objective. While, the real-world FLPs are multi-objective by nature. Only very recently have meta-heuristics been designed and used in multi-objective FLP. They most often use the weighted sum method to combine the different objectives and thus, inherit the well-known problems of this method. As of now, there is no formal approach published for the unequal area multi-objective FLP to consider several objectives simultaneously. This paper presents an evolutionary approach for solving multi-objective unequal area FLP using multi-objective genetic algorithm that presents the layout as a set of Pareto-optimal solutions optimising multiple objectives simultaneously. The experimental results show that the proposed approach performs well in dealing with multi-objective unequal area FLPs which better reflects the real-world scenario.},

 abstract = {This paper addresses the preliminary robust design of a small-medium scale re-entry unmanned space vehicle. A hybrid optimisation technique is proposed that couples an evolutionary multi-objective algorithm with a direct transcription method for optimal control problems. Uncertainties on the aerodynamic forces and vehicle mass are integrated in the design process and the hybrid algorithm searches for geometries that minimise the mean value of the maximum heat flux, the mean value of the maximum achievable distance, and the variance of the maximum heat flux. The evolutionary part handles the system design parameters of the vehicle and the uncertain functions, while the direct transcription method generates optimal control profiles for the re-entry trajectory of each individual of the population. During the optimisation process, artificial neural networks are used to approximate the aerodynamic forces required by the direct transcription method. The artificial neural networks are trained and updated by means of a multi-fidelity, evolution control approach.},

In this paper we propose a new methodology for solving the capacitated facility location problem (CFLP) based on combining an evolutionary multi-objective algorithm with Lagrangian Relaxation where financial costs and CO2 emissions are considered simultaneously. Two levels of decision making are required: 1) which facilities to open from a set of potential sites, and 2) which customers to assign to which open facilities without violating their capacity. We choose SEAMO2 (Simple Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimisation 2) as our multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to determine which facilities to open, because of its fast execution speed. For the allocation of customers to open facilities we use a Lagrangian Relaxation technique. We test our approach on large problem instances with realistic qualities, and validate solution quality by comparison with extreme solutions obtained using CPLEX.},

 abstract = {Several computational models have been developed in the context of the Protein Structure Prediction (PSP) problem. These methods involve a combinatorial problem and can be solved using optimising algorithms in order to search for a global minimum energy. Genetic Algorithms (GAs) have produced relevant results in this area. Several energies in the protein are known to be directly responsible for the stabilisation of their structures. These energies can represent each objective of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms. Many techniques, as the NSGA-II, are used to deal with the multi-objective approach for proteins, however they are not adequate for the PSP problem. New strategies have been sought with multiple criteria. In this context, this paper introduces the application of multiobjective evolutionary algorithm on tables algorithm to the PSP problem. In order to evaluate this approach, we compare it with the well-known NSGA-II algorithm. The new approach investigated for PSP can generate protein structures with energies significantly smaller than those generated by the NSGA-II.},

To solve MR-POMDPs, we present two hybrid (memetic) multi-objective evolutionary algorithms that generate non-dominated sets of policies (in the form of stochastic finite state controllers). Performance comparisons between the methods on multi-objective problems in robotics (with 2, 3 and 5 objectives), web-advertising (with 3, 4 and 5 objectives) and infectious disease control (with 3 objectives), revealed that memetic variants outperformed their original counterparts. We anticipate that the MR-POMDP along with multi-objective evolutionary solvers will prove useful in a variety of theoretical and real-world applications.},

In MOEA/D, a multi-objective problem (MOP) can be decomposed into several single-objective sub-problems. Thus, the preference incorporation mechanism in our algorithm is implemented by selecting the preferred sub-problems rather than the preferred region in the objective space. At each interaction, iMOEA/D offers a set of current solutions and asks the DM to choose the most preferred one. Then, the search will be guided to the neighbourhood of the selected. iMOEA/D is tested on some benchmark problems, and various utility functions are used to simulate the DM's responses. The experimental studies show that iMOEA/D can handle the preference information very well and successfully converge to the expected preferred regions.},

Previous evolutionary optimisation methods aim to find a set of well-converged and evenly-distributed Pareto-optimal solutions. We present a novel evolutionary algorithm (EA) that interacts with a decision maker (DM) during the optimisation process to obtain the DM's most preferred solution. First, the theory of a preference polyhedron for an optimisation problem with interval parameters is built up. Then, an interactive evolutionary algorithm (IEA) for MOO problems with interval parameters based on the above preference polyhedron is developed. The algorithm periodically provides a part of non-dominated solutions to the DM, and a preference polyhedron, based on which optimal solutions are ranked, is constructed with the worst solution chosen by the DM as the vertex. Finally, our method is tested on two bi-objective optimisation problems with interval parameters using two different value function types to emulate the DM's responses. The experimental results show its simplicity and superiority to the posteriori method.},

This paper presents a method for visualising 4D approximation sets which performs dimension reduction using prosections (projections of a section). The method yields a prosection matrix---a matrix of intuitive 3D scatter plots that well reproduce the shape, range and distribution of vectors in the observed approximation set. The performance of visualisation with prosections is analysed theoretically and demonstrated on two examples with approximation sets of state-of-the-art test optimisation problems.},

 abstract = {The core of hypervolume-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithms is an archiving algorithm which performs the environmental selection. A (mu+lambda)-archiving algorithm defines how to choose mu children from mu parents and lambda offspring together. We study theoretically (mu+lambda)-archiving algorithms which never decrease the hypervolume from one generation to the next. Zitzler, Thiele, and Bader (IEEE Trans. Evolutionary Computation, 14:58--79, 2010) proved that all (mu+1)-archiving algorithms are ineffective, which means there is an initial population such that independent of the used reproduction rule, a set with maximum hypervolume cannot be reached. We extend this and prove that for lambda<mu all archiving algorithms are ineffective. On the other hand, locally optimal algorithms, which maximise the hypervolume in each step, are effective for lambda=mu and can always find a population with hypervolume at least half the optimum for lambda < mu.

We also prove that there is no hypervolume-based archiving algorithm which can always find a population with hypervolume greater than 1 / (1 + 0.1338, ( 1/lambda - 1/mu) ) times the optimum.},

In this work, we further improve search performance of S-CDAS in MaOPs by analysing genetic diversity in many-objective problems and enhancing crossover operators. First, we analyse genetic diversity in the population and the contribution of the conventional genetic operators when we increase the number of objectives, showing that the genetic diversity in the population significantly increases and offspring created by conventional crossover come to be not selected as parents because the operator becomes too disruptive and its effectiveness decrease. To overcome this problem, we implement crossover controlling the number of crossed genes (CCG) in S-CDAS and verify its effectiveness. Through performance verification using many-objective knapsack problems with 4-10 objectives, we show that the search performance of S-CDAS noticeably improves when we restrict the number of crossed genes. Also, we show that the effectiveness of CCG operator becomes significant as we increase the number of objectives. Furthermore, we show that offspring created by CCG are selected as parents more often than conventional crossover.},

 abstract = {Algorithms capable of performing efficient and controllable many objective optimisation are becoming more necessary as the complexity of optimisation problems to be solved increases. This paper describes a new algorithm that combines elements of traditional gradient based optimisation methods along with a powerful many-objective capable search process. The algorithm exploits the directed line search (such as Golden Section Search) procedures found in many single-objective gradient based algorithms in order to both explore and exploit features in the optimisation landscape. The target vector and aggregation methods used in the MSOPS algorithm have been employed to provide effective and controllable many-objective optimisation, especially suited to close interaction with a designer where it is often desired to target specific regions of the Pareto front. The Many Objective Directed Evolutionary Line Search (MODELS) algorithm is demonstrated on a constrained function with a concave Pareto front in up to 20 dimensions and is shown to outperform existing optimisers, some of which are known to perform well for many-objective problems.},

However, there is a very little knowledge on the landscape of multiobjective problems. In this work, following a recent proposal by Zitzler et al. (2010), we consider multiobjective optimisation as a set problem. Then, we give a general definition of set-based multiobjective fitness landscapes. An experimental set-based fitness landscape analysis is conducted on the multiobjective NK-landscapes with objective correlation. The aim is to adapt and to enhance the comprehensive design of set-based multiobjective search approaches, motivated by an a priori analysis of the corresponding set problem properties.},

 abstract = {Abstract In this paper, a new Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA) named RankMOEA is proposed. Innovative niching and ranking-mutation procedures which avoid the need of parameters definition are involved; such procedures outperform traditional diversity-preservation mechanisms under spread-hardness situations. RankMOEA performance is compared with those of other state of the art MOEAs: MOGA, NSGA-II and SPEA2, showing remarkable improvements. RankMOEA is also applied to approximate the Pareto Front of a Dynamic Principal-Agent model with Discrete Actions posed in a Multi-Objective Optimisation framework allowing to consider more powerful assumptions than those used in the traditional single-objective optimisation approach. Within this new framework a set of feasible contracts is described, while others similar studies only focus on one single contract. The results achieved with RankMOEA show better spread and minor error than those obtained by already mentioned MOEAs, allowing to perform better economic analysis by characterising contracts in the trade-off surface.},

 abstract = {Objective evaluation is subject to noise in many real-world problems. The noise can deteriorate the performance of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, by misleading the population to a local optimum and reducing the convergence rate. This paper proposes three novel noise handling techniques: accumulative sampling, a new ranking method, and a different selection scheme for recombination. The accumulative sampling is basically a kind of dynamic resampling, but it does not explicitly decide the number of samples. Instead, it repeatedly takes additional samples of objectives for the solutions in the archive at every generation, and updates the estimated objectives using all the accumulated samples. The new ranking method combines probabilistic Pareto rank and crowding distance into a single aggregated value to promote the diversity in the archive. Finally, the fitness function and selection method used for recombination are made different from those for the archive to accelerate the convergence rate. Experiments on various benchmark problems have shown that the algorithm adopting all these features performs better than other MOEAs in various performance metrics.},

However, these results are, in the multiobjective case, quite pessimistic, due to the huge family of fitness functions considered. Combining assumptions on fitness functions and traditional comparison-based assumptions, we get more realistic bounds emphasising the importance of reducing the number of conflicting objectives for reducing the runtime of multiobjective optimisation. The approach can in particular predict lower bounds on the computation time, depending on the type of requested convergence: pointwise, or to the whole Pareto set. Also, a new (untested yet) algorithm is proposed for approximating the whole Pareto set.},

This multi-objective optimisation problem (MOP) can be solved on the smallest unit of the IC, the standard cells, to improve the performance of the entire circuit. In this work, transistor sizing of an IC is approached via a multi-objective approach which includes the use of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs). We compare the performance of two MOEAs on a four-dimensional MOP of a particular standard cell. The results indicate that evolutionary strategies are suitable for the treatment of such problems and advantageous against other rather classical methods.},

Experiments on the BBOB 2010 test cases suggest that the performance is at least competitive while the approach provides more options, e.g. setting more than one parameter at once. Essentially, we argue that SPO is a generalisation of the IPOP heuristic and that the distinction between tuning and control is---although often useful---an artificial one.},

We investigate the effect of these problem properties on the performance of different basin identification methods (as subtasks of niching algorithms), namely nearest-better clustering, detect-multimodal, and Jarvis-Patrick clustering, individually, or in combinations. Employing an existing problem generator that enables complete control and knowledge of basins, instances are generated and validated according to predefined property values and the basin identification performance data is modelled in order to detect similarities that may be interpreted as effects of the stated properties. We also give recommendations concerning usage of basin identification methods in different situations. Our approach is strongly related to the recently suggested general idea of exploratory landscape analysis (ELA).},

NES follows the natural gradient of the expected fitness on the parameters of its search distribution. While general in its formulation, previous research has focused on multivariate Gaussian search distributions. Here we exhibit problem classes for which other search distributions are more appropriate, and then derive corresponding NES-variants.

First, for separable distributions we obtain SNES, whose complexity is only O(d) instead of O(d3). We apply SNES to problems of previously unattainable dimensionality, recovering lowest-energy structures on the Lennard-Jones atom clusters, and obtaining state-of-the-art results on neuro-evolution benchmarks. Second, we develop a new, equivalent formulation based on invariances. This allows for generalising NES to heavy-tailed distributions, even those with undefined variance, which aids in overcoming deceptive local optima.},

 abstract = {This paper introduces mirrored sampling into evolution strategies (ESs) with weighted multi-recombination. Two further heuristics are introduced: pairwise selection selects at most one of two mirrored vectors in order to avoid a bias due to recombination. Selective mirroring only mirrors the worst solutions of the population. Convergence rates on the sphere function are derived that also yield upper bounds for the convergence rate on any spherical function. The optimal fraction of offspring to be mirrored is regardless of pairwise selection one without selective mirroring and about 19percent with selective mirroring, where the convergence rate reaches a value of 0.390. This is an improvement of 56percent compared to the best known convergence rate of 0.25 with positive recombination weights.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new variant of the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy with local meta-models (lmm-CMA) for optimising partially separable functions. We propose to exploit partial separability by building at each iteration a meta-model for each element function (or sub-function) using a full quadratic local model. After introducing the approach we present some first experiments using element functions with dimensions 2 and 4. Our results demonstrate that, as expected, exploiting partial separability leads to an important speedup compared to the standard CMA-ES. We show on the tested functions that the speedup increases with increasing dimensions for a fixed dimension of the element function. On the standard Rosenbrock function the maximum speedup of lambda is reached in dimension 40 using element functions of dimension 2. We show also that higher speedups can be achieved by increasing the population size. The choice of the number of points used to build the meta-model is also described and the computational cost is discussed.},

In this setting, finding robust optima can be recast as an optimisation problem with an/a uncertain/noisy objective function. This paper studies whether state-of-the-art uncertainty handling techniques, proposed in the context of optimising noisy objective functions, can be applied for finding robust optima. In this paper, the UH-CMA-ES is modified to handle approximations of the effective fitness. This modified approach, named RO-UH-CMA-ES, is evaluated empirically and compared to other schemes that aim to find robust optima. The experiments on multiple benchmark problems show that the RO-UH-CMA-ES yields comparable results for multi-modal problems and it outperforms other schemes on unimodal problems.},

 abstract = {Independence from the coordinate system is one source of efficiency and robustness for the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES). The recently proposed Adaptive Encoding (AE) procedure generalises CMA-ES adaptive mechanism, and can be used together with any optimisation algorithm. Adaptive Encoding gradually builds a transformation of the coordinate system such that the new coordinates are as decorrelated as possible with respect to the objective function. But any optimisation algorithm can then be used together with Adaptive Encoding, and this paper proposes to use one of the simplest of all, that uses a dichotomy procedure on each coordinate in turn. The resulting algorithm, termed Adaptive Coordinate Descent (ACiD), is analysed on the Sphere function, and experimentally validated on BBOB testbench where it is shown to outperform the standard (1+1)-CMA-ES, and is found comparable to other state-of-the-art CMA-ES variants.},

In particular, it focuses on the log-normal update rule for adapting the mutation rate, incorporated in a (mu, lambda)-strategy. Although it is well known that this update rule requires a lower boundary of the mutation rate to prevent it from collapsing to zero, the naive approach of enforcing a fixed lower boundary has undesirable side-effects. This paper studies the dynamics of the fixed lower boundary approach in depth and proposes a simple alternative for dealing with the lower boundary issue.},

 abstract = {Genetic algorithm is one of the well-known population based meta-heuristics. The reasonable performance of the algorithm on a wide variety of problems as well as its simplicity made this algorithm a first choice in lots of cases. However, the algorithm has some weaknesses such as the existence of some parameters that need to be carefully set before the run. The capability of the parameters to change the balance between exploration and exploitation make them crucial. Exploration and exploitation are the bases of every evolutionary algorithm. Conducting a balance between these elements is crucial for the success of any evolutionary algorithm. In this research a GA is proposed on which the crossover and mutation rates are removed. A probability vector holds the probability of the alleles for every locus within the individual. The probability is with regards to the contribution of the allele on either increasing or decreasing the fitness of the chromosome. The probability of an allele will increase if the fitness of the chromosome increases by a change or vise versa. The experiments conducted on a wide range of multi-modal and epistatic problems show good performance of the proposed method in comparison to other algorithms in literature.},

In a previous article, we introduced an method, diversity-reference adaptive control (DRAC), to control population diversity based on reference diversity. DRAC aims to track an appropriate diversity level through a control-based strategy. In such a strategy, the evolutionary process is seen as a control problem, in which the process output is the population diversity and the process input is one or more EA adjustable parameters. In that first version of DRAC, the evolutionary process is treated as a black box, thus, the updating of the control variables is made as a function of the error between the population diversity and the reference-model diversity. The DRAC approach does not consider sensitivity analysis. In the current version, a population dynamics model is used to describe the evolutionary process and to allow the control variables updating.},

The new methodology combines the classical approach to automatic orthogonal graph drawings,the topology-shape-metric approach, and a multiobjective genetic algorithm based on the NSGA-II method. In the topology-shape-metric method, a fixed planar embedding is obtained in the planarization step and submitted to the orthogonalization and compaction steps, in this order. In the hybrid approach, a greater number of planar embeddings is explored by varying the order of edges insertion that forms the planar embedding in the planarization step. The problem is then formulated as a multiobjective permutationbased combinatorial optimization problem, considering the minimization of the number of crossings, the number of bends and the area of the drawing. Solutions on the estimated Pareto front represent different drawings, that can be stored and selected by the user in real-time. We illustrate a possible multicriteria decision making based on fuzzy decision. The results show that the hybrid methodology using NSGA-II is able to find good and diverse solutions, when compared to the traditional topology-shape-metric method.},

In this research, we investigate how a genetic algorithm can be applied to design this network and determine the optimal location of each seismic sensing station. The number of earthquakes detected by the designed network will be used as a reference point with respect to the currently installed seismic alert system (SAS). This metric will justify the use of the genetic algorithms as a designing tool prior to the construction of the network in different regions of Mexico. The SAS stations and each solution proposed by a genetic algorithm underwent a procedure, in which it is simulated the occurrence of earthquakes obtained from the Mexico's National Seismological Service (SSN) database, to determinate its efficiency in terms of the time to warn Mexico City.},

 abstract = {Rigid motion estimation from image point correspondences is an overconstrained problem that can be solved by minimizing an adequate cost function. Given the unreliable nature of image point correspondences, they must be divided into two categories: inliers and outliers. Finding the correct camera motion and discarding the outliers is a coupled problem usually solved by a random search of the solution space. This article proposes adaptive and hybrid genetic approaches to improve the efficiency of this search. We build on top of the GASAC algorithm that has been recently presented for solving problems in geometric computer vision. GASAC is modified to address the specific issues of camera motion estimation such as outlier ratios above 50percent due to wide-baseline image acquisition and an adequate choice of a fitness function. In order to avoid local minima, we propose three adaptive strategies: varying the mutation probability, resampling the lowest ranked individuals, and using a hybrid approach that combines GASAC with simulated annealing. Results are validated on publicly available benchmark images, and it is shown that the proposed genetic approaches outperform the standard RANSAC search used among computer vision practitioners.},

 abstract = {Evolutionary algorithms are often evaluated by measuring and comparing their ability to consistently reach objectives chosen a priori by researchers. Yet recent results from experiments without explicit a priori objectives, such as in Picbreeder and with the novelty search algorithm, raise the question of whether the very act of setting an objective is exacting a subtle price. Nature provides another hint that the reigning objective-based paradigm may be obfuscating evolutionary computation's true potential; after all, many of the greatest discoveries of natural evolution, such as flight and human-level intelligence, were not set as a priori objectives at the beginning of the search. The dangerous question is whether such triumphs only result because they were not objectives. To examine this question, this paper takes the unusual experimental approach of attempting to re-evolve images that were already once evolved on Picbreeder. In effect, images that were originally discovered serendipitously become a priori objectives for a new experiment with the same algorithm. Therefore, the resulting failure to reproduce the very same results cannot be blamed on the evolutionary algorithm, setting the stage for a contemplation of the price we pay for evaluating our algorithms only for their ability to achieve preconceived objectives.},

 abstract = {Novelty search is a recently proposed method for evolutionary computation designed to avoid the problem of deception, in which the fitness function guides the search process away from global optima. Novelty search replaces fitness-based selection with novelty-based selection, where novelty is measured by comparing an individual's behavior to that of the current population and an archive of past novel individuals. Though there is substantial evidence that novelty search can overcome the problem of deception, the critical factors in its performance remain poorly understood. This paper helps to bridge this gap by analyzing how the behavior function, which maps each genotype to a behavior, affects performance. We propose the notion of descendant fitness probability (DFP), which describes how likely a genotype's descendants are to have a certain fitness, and formulate two hypotheses about when changes to the behavior function will improve novelty search's performance, based on the effect of those changes on behavior and DFP. Experiments in both artificial and deceptive maze domains provide substantial empirical support for these hypotheses.},

 abstract = {When the epistasis of the fitness function is bounded by a constant, we show that the expected fitness of an offspring of the (1+1)-EA can be efficiently computed for any point. Moreover, we show that, for any point, it is always possible to efficiently retrieve the best mutation rate at that point in the sense that the expected fitness of the resulting offspring is maximized. On linear functions, it has been shown that a mutation rate of 1/n is provably optimal. On functions where epistasis is bounded by a constant k, we show that for sufficiently high fitness, the commonly used mutation rate of 1/n is also best, at least in terms of maximizing the expected fitness of the offspring. However, we find for certain ranges of the fitness function, a better mutation rate can be considerably higher, and can be found by solving for the real roots of a degree-k polynomial whose coefficients contain the nonzero Walsh coefficients of the fitness function. Simulation results on maximum k-satisfiability problems and NK-landscapes show that this expectation-maximized mutation rate can cause significant gains early in search.},

It is thus one of the few means trying to understand which problems are tractable for genetic algorithms and other randomized search heuristics. Most previous work on black-box complexity is on artificial test functions. In this paper, we move a step forward and give a detailed analysis for the two combinatorial problems minimum spanning tree and single-source shortest paths. Besides giving interesting bounds for their black-box complexities, our work reveals that the choice of how to model the optimization problem is non-trivial here. This in particular comes true where the search space does not consist of bit strings and where a reasonable definition of unbiasedness has to be agreed on.},

 abstract = {Understanding the impact of crossover on performance is a major problem in the theory of genetic algorithms (GAs). We present new insight on working principles of crossover by analyzing the performance of crossover-based GAs on the simple functions OneMax and Jump.

First, we assess the potential speedup by crossover when combined with a fitness-invariant bit shuffling operator that simulates a lineage of independent evolution on a function of unitation. Theoretical and empirical results show drastic speedups for both functions.

Second, we consider a simple GA without shuffling and investigate the interplay of mutation and crossover on Jump. If the crossover probability is small, subsequent mutations create sufficient diversity, even for very small populations. Contrarily, with high crossover probabilities crossover tends to lose diversity more quickly than mutation can create it. This has a drastic impact on the performance on Jump. We complement our theoretical findings by Monte Carlo simulations on the population diversity.},

When linkage exists, the fitness contribution of one gene depends on the allele setting of another. Our approach, a surrogate-assisted linkage inference genetic algorithm (SALIGA), is able to detect linkage for real-valued alleles. It uses a perturbation-based method with the aid of fitness surrogates and clustering techniques. Experimental results of linkage inference applied to several synthetic fitness functions are provided. The results demonstrate that SALIGA is able to reliably infer linkage and will correctly group the genes of an individual according to their linkage group membership, while using fewer fitness evaluations through a surrogate model. In addition, our results are augmented with a discussion regarding linkage detection through feature selection.},

In order to overcome some of the difficulties that GAs face when searching deceptive landscapes, we introduce two new multi-chromosome genetic algorithms. These multi-chromosome genetic algorithms have been designed to accelerate the GA's search speed in more complicated deceptive problems by looking for a balance between diversity and convergence. Five different problems are used in testing to illustrate the usefulness of our proposed approaches. The results show that the lack of diversity is not the only reason that normal GAs have difficulty in solving deceptive problems but that convergence direction is also important.},

 abstract = {Accelerating the convergence of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) is a significant and promising research direction of evolutionary computation. In this paper, a novel Index-based GA (termed IndexGA) is proposed for the acceleration of convergence by reducing the number of fitness evaluations (FEs) in the reproduction procedure, i.e. the process of crossover and mutation. The algorithm divides the solution space into multiple regions, each represented by a unique index. Individuals in the IndexGA are redefined as indexes instead of solutions. In the reproduction procedure, an evaluated region is never evaluated again, and the fitness is directly obtained from the memory. Moreover, to improve the fitness of the promising regions, the algorithm performs an orthogonal local search (OLS) operator on the best-so-far region in each generation. Numerical experiments have been conducted on 13 benchmark functions and an application problem of power electronic circuit (PEC) to investigate the performance of IndexGA. The results show that the index-based strategy and the OLS in IndexGA significantly enhance the performance of GAs in terms of both convergence rate and solution accuracy.},

In this paper we investigate the use of three different explicit memory strategies included in the CHC algorithm. These strategies - direct, immigrant and associative - combined with the CHC algorithm are used to solve different instances of the dynamic Traveling Salesman Problem in cyclic, noisy and random environments. The experimental results, statistically validated, show that the memory schemes significantly improve the performance of the original CHC algorithm for all types of studied environments. Moreover, when compared with the equivalent memory-based standard EAs with the same memory schemes, the memory-based CHC algorithms obtain superior results when the environmental changes are slower.},

Evolutionary System Definition Language (ESDL) is a conceptual model and language for describing evolutionary systems efficiently and with reduced ambiguity, including systems with multiple populations and adaptive parameters. ESDL may also be machine-interpreted, allowing algorithms to be tested without requiring a hand-coded implementation, as may already be done using the esec framework.

 abstract = {The use of niching methods for solving real world optimization problems is limited by the difficulty to obtain a proper setting of the speciation parameters without any a priori information about the fitness landscape. To avoid such a difficulty, we propose a novel method, called Adaptive Species Discovery, that removes the basic assumption of perfect discrimination among peaks underlying Fitness Sharing and, consequently, allows to overcome the drawbacks of the most performing sharing-based methods. This is achieved through an explicit mechanism able to discover the species in the population during the evolution. The method does not require any a priori knowledge, in that it makes no assumption about the location and the shape of the peaks, while it exploits information about the ruggedness of the fitness landscape, dynamically acquired at each generation. The proposed method has been evaluated on a set of standard functions largely adopted in the literature to assess the performance of niching methods. The experimental results show that our method has a better ability to discover and maintain all the peaks with respect to other methods proposed so far.},

 abstract = {We introduce the Spacing Memetic Algorithm (SMA), a formal evolutionary model devoted to a systematic control of spacing (distances) among individuals. SMA uses search space distance information to decide what individuals are acceptable in the population, what individuals need to be replaced and when to apply mutations. By ensuring a healthy spacing (and thus diversity), SMA substantially reduces the risk of premature convergence and helps the search process to continuously discover new high-quality search areas. Generally speaking, the number of distance calculations represents a limited computational overhead compared to the number of local search iterations. Most existing memetic algorithms can be upgraded to a spacing memetic algorithm, provided that a suitable distance measure can be specified. The impact of the main SMA components is assessed within several case studies on different problems.},

 abstract = {Mate selection is a key step in evolutionary algorithms which traditionally has been panmictic and based solely on fitness. Various mate selection techniques have been published which show improved performance due to the introduction of mate restrictions or the use of genotypic/phenotypic features. Those techniques typically suffer from two major shortcomings: (1) they are fixed for the entire evolutionary run, which is suboptimal because problem specific mate selection may be expected to outperform general purpose mate selection and because the best mate selection configuration may be dependent on the state of the evolutionary run, and (2) they require problem specific tuning in order to obtain good performance, which often is a time consuming manual process. This paper introduces two versions of Learning Individual Mating Preferences (LIMP), a novel mate selection technique in which characteristics of good mates are learned during the evolutionary process. Centralized LIMP (C-LIMP) learns at the population level, while Decentralized LIMP (D-LIMP) learns at the individual level. Results are presented showing D-LIMP to outperform a traditional genetic algorithm (TGA), the Variable Dissortative Mating Genetic Algorithm (VDMGA), and C-LIMP on the DTRAP and MAXSAT benchmark problems, while both LIMP techniques perform comparably to VDMGA on NK Landscapes.},

It is an effective and robust approach to image segmentation on the basis of a total similarity function relating to the approximate density shape estimation. In the new algorithm, a dynamic identification of the niches is performed at each generation to automatically evolve the proper number of clusters and appropriate cluster centers of the data set. Moreover, a local search method is embeded in the evolutionary process which makes the dynamic niching method insensitive to the radius of the niche. Compared to existing methods, DNGA algorithm does not need to pre-specify the number of segmentation. Several images are used to demonstrate its superiority. The experimental results show that DNGA algorithm has high performance, effectiveness and flexibility.},

DE/cluster applies a simple hierarchical clustering model to mine the distribution information of the DE population every K generations to make a dynamic partition of the population. One special cluster formed by the single-individual clusters will use a slower convergence mutation strategy to do the global search. The other clusters will use more greedy searching strategy to do the local search. As long as the subpopulations may be trapped by local minima, the dead state is defined for a cluster and clusters will be checked in every generation and the dead clusters will be restarted in the current searching range. This local restart strategy can make the performance of DE/cluster even be better than DE/rand on some multimodal test functions that are not linearly separable. The DE/cluster algorithm is tested on a test suite with 24 functions and it shows promising performance compared with the current best DE variants.},

 abstract = {Differential evolution (DE) is one of the most successful evolutionary algorithms (EAs) for global numerical optimization. Like other EAs, maintaining population diversity is important for DE to escape from local optima and locate a near-global optimum. Using a multi-population algorithm is a representative method to avoid early loss of population diversity. In this paper, we propose a multi-population DE algorithm (MPDE) which manipulates multiple sub-populations. Different sub-populations in MPDE exchange information via a novel mutation operation instead of migration used in most multi-population EAs. The mutation operation is helpful to balance the fast convergence and population diversity of the proposed algorithm. Moreover, the performance of MPDE is further improved by an adaptive parameter control scheme designed based on the multi-population approach. Each sub-population in MPDE evolves with its own set of control parameters, and a learning strategy is used to adaptively adjust the parameter values. A set of benchmark functions is used to test the proposed MPDE algorithm. The experimental results show that MPDE performs better than, or at least comparably, to the classical single population DE with fixed parameter values and three existing state-of-the-art DE variants.},

The amount of global exploration and local exploitation to be carried out, for optimal performance, varies with problem type. Therefore, an algorithm should intelligently allocate its computational efforts between genetic search and local search. In this work we propose an adaptive local search method that adjusts the effort for local tuning of individuals, taking feedback from the search. We implemented an MA hybridizing this adaptive local search method with differential evolution algorithm. Experimenting with a standard benchmark suite it was found that the proposed MA can use its global and local search components adaptively. The proposed algorithm also exhibited very competitive performance with other existing algorithms.},

In this paper we propose a coevolutionary algorithm that approximates behavioural strategy Nash equilibria in n-player zero sum games, by exploiting the min-max solution concept. In order to support our case we provide a set of experiments in both games of known and unknown equilibria. In the case of known equilibria, we can confirm our algorithm converges to the known solution, while in the case of unknown equilibria we can see a steady progress towards Nash.},

In a non-separable (epistatic) optimization problem, dividing the computational budget equally between all of the subcomponents is not necessarily the best strategy. When dealing with non-separable problems, there is usually an imbalance between the contribution of various subcomponents to the global fitness of the individuals. Using a round-robin fashion treats all of the subcomponents equally and wastes the computational budget. In this paper, we propose a Contribution Based Cooperative Co-evolution (CBCC) that selects the subcomponents based on their contributions to the global fitness. This alleviates the imbalance issue and allows the computational resources to be used more efficiently. Experiments on several benchmark functions with the imbalance issue show that this new scheme is promising, especially when it is combined with a grouping algorithm that captures interacting variables in common subcomponents.},

Two different games with varying reward values - the N-player Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (N-IPD) and the N-player Iterated Snowdrift game (N-ISD) - form the basis of this study. Here, the agents playing the game are mapped to the nodes of different network architectures, ranging from regular lattices to small-world networks and random graphs. In a given game instance, the focal agent participates in an iterative game with N-1 other agents drawn from its local neighbourhood. We use a genetic algorithm with synchronous updating to evolve agent strategies. Extensive Monte Carlo simulation experiments show that for smaller cost-to-benefit ratios, the extent of cooperation in both games decreases as the probability of re-wiring increases. For higher cost-to-benefit ratios, when the re-wiring probability is small we observe an increase in the level of cooperation in the N-IPD population, but not the N-ISD population. This suggests that the small-world network structure with small re-wiring probabilities can both promote and maintain higher levels of cooperation when the game becomes more challenging.},

 abstract = {For problems involving uncertainties in design variables and parameters, a bi-objective evolutionary algorithm (EA) based approach to design optimization using evidence theory is proposed and implemented in this paper. In addition to a functional objective, a plausibility measure of failure of constraint satisfaction is minimized. Despite some interests in classical optimization literature, such a consideration in EA is rare. Due to EA's flexibility in its operators, non-requirement of any gradient, its ability to handle multiple conflicting objectives, and ease of parallelization, evidence-based design optimization using an EA is promising. Results on a test problem and a couple of engineering design problems show that the modified evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) algorithm is capable of finding a widely distributed trade-off frontier showing different optimal solutions corresponding to different levels of plausibility failure limits. Furthermore, a single-objective evidence based EA is found to produce better optimal solutions than a previously reported classical optimization procedure. Handling uncertainties of different types are getting increasingly popular in applied optimization studies and more such studies using EAs will make EAs more useful and pragmatic in practical optimization problem-solving tasks.},

 abstract = {Cellular automata (CA) are able to perform complex computations through local interactions. The investigation of how CA computations are carried out can be made by the usage of CA rules to solve specific tasks. The well-known problem called density classification task (DCT) is investigated, with focus on its two-dimensional version. Evolutionary algorithms have been widely used in the search for DCT rules. A sample of lattices with Gaussian distribution is commonly used to evaluate rule quality. However, uniform lattices are easier to classify, allowing an initial selective pressure needed to start the convergence. A comparative evaluation of three adaptive strategies is presented here: they start using easy lattices to classify and as effective rules are being obtained the difficult level is progressively increased toward the target evaluation. Several experiments were performed to evaluate the strategies efficiency and new rules were found, which outperform the best ones published.},

 abstract = {Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a relatively recent swarm intelligence algorithm inspired from social learning of animals. Successful implementation of PSO depends on many parameters. Inertia weight is one of them. The selection of an appropriate strategy for varying inertia weight w is one of the most effective ways of improving the performance of PSO. Most of the works done till date for investigating inertia weight have considered small values of w, generally in the range [0,1]. This paper presents some experiments with widely varying values of w which adapts itself according to improvement in fitness at each iteration. The same strategy has been implemented in two different ways giving rise to two inertia weight variants of PSO namely Globally Adaptive Inertia Weight (GAIW) PSO, and Locally Adaptive Inertia Weight (LAIW) PSO. The performance of the proposed variants has been compared with three existing inertia weight variants of PSO employing a test suite of 6 benchmark global optimization problems. The experiments show that the results obtained by the proposed variants are comparable with those obtained by the existing ones but with better convergence speed and less computational effort.},

 abstract = {When designing real-time systems, predictability is of utmost importance. A locking cache is a cache memory that allows loading and locking instructions, thus avoiding their replacement. This way, regarding memory accesses, execution time of instructions is constant since it does not depend on the sequence of memory references. With a predictable behaviour, locking cache memories are a practical alternative to conventional caches for real-time systems. Offering similar performance to conventional caches, locking caches allow an accurate yet simple schedulability analysis.

Locking caches may also help to reduce the size of a system, by means of reducing cache size. When reducing cache size, also cost and power consumption may be reduced. This way, both predictability and cost saving is provided by means of locking cache.

This work presents a set of algorithms, aimed to select the contents of a locking cache that provides the minimum locking cache size, while the system remains schedulable. Compared to a previous approach, the algorithms presented in this paper are able to select a set of main memory blocks that result in a smaller cache size.},

 abstract = {Recent study has introduced the powerful selection scheme in cellular genetic algorithm that can produce all ranges of selective pressure. The parameters used in that study, however, are empirically estimated by numbers of experiments. In this study, we propose the idea of performing a parameter estimation from a theoretical perspective. In the concept of maximizing the probability to find the new best solution together with hill-climbing optimization, enabling search for an optimal parameter in each generation. The selection scheme with the optimal parameter yields the numbers of mating that maximizes the probability of finding better solutions. This optimal parameter changes during run and it is adaptive to the behavior of a particular evolution. In order to confirm the capability of this parameter estimation method, we have conducted experiments to compare the manually tuned static parameter and the estimated dynamic parameter obtained from this method. Result from the experiment shows that the algorithm with estimated parameter performed better than the former method, even with the best tuned parameter. Therefore, by applying this parameter estimation to the selection scheme stated at the beginning, we would be able to create a new universal adaptive paradigm for the cellular evolutionary algorithm.},

 abstract = {Standard genetic algorithms can discover good fitness regions and later forget them due to their Markovian structure, resulting in suboptimal performance. Real-Space Evolutionary Annealing (REA) hybridizes simulated annealing and genetic algorithms into a provably convergent evolutionary algorithm for Euclidean space that relies on non-Markovian selection. REA selects any previously observed solution from an approximated Boltzmann distribution using a cooling schedule. This method enables REA to escape local optima while retaining information about prior generations. In parallel work, REA has been generalized to arbitrary measure spaces and shown to be asymptotically convergent to the global optima. This paper compares REA experimentally to six popular optimization algorithms, including Differential Evolution, Particle Swarm Optimization, Correlated Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategies, the real-coded Bayesian Optimization Algorithm, a real-coded genetic algorithm, and simulated annealing. REA converges faster to the global optimum and succeeds more often on two out of three multimodal, non-separable benchmarks and performs strongly on all three. In particular, REA vastly outperforms the real-coded genetic algorithm and simulated annealing, proving that the hybridization is better than either algorithm alone. REA is therefore an interesting and effective algorithm for global optimization of difficult fitness functions.},

Extremely exploitative algorithm settings performed best for a surprisingly wide range of problems; even where they were not the most effective, they still performed competitively, and even in those cases, the best performers were still far more exploitative than most would anticipate.},

 abstract = {Predicting optimal size and mix of future transportation fleets is of great importance to defence logistics planners but faces some challenges. Firstly, the future is uncertain because the environment changes constantly and adversaries are highly adaptive. Secondly, optimising a large heterogeneous transport fleet is inherently complex. Heuristic-based optimisation techniques are therefore often applied that provide approximate solutions to support the decision making in such complex problems. However, heuristic-based methods act as black boxes and do not offer insights into the relationships between future scenarios and the solutions found. In this paper, we use an evolutionary rule-based approach to understand these relationships. A multi-objective Learning Classifier System (LCS) is employed to learn interpretable patterns of future scenarios and to associate them with the best performing heuristics under given conditions. To accomplish this, two novel reward functions are introduced that assign credits to classifiers based on the multi-objective performance of the predicted heuristics. Results show that LCS generalises well to relate scenario characteristics with Pareto optimal heuristics.},

Our algorithm can be applied to the additive and multiplicative decomposable problems and problems that have both kind of decomposability, i.e. hybrid decomposability. By using IDHDP, an interaction matrix is computed that represents the degree of interaction between pairs of loci. To extract linkage groups from the interaction matrix, a local threshold is calculated for each variable by the two-means algorithm. We apply IDHDP to problems with different types of decomposability. A comparison with some existing algorithms shows the efficiency and effectiveness of IDHDP.},

In this paper, a knowledge representation based on fuzzy membership function offering certain and vague regions is described. We extend the Michigan learning classifier system using this approach to be improved in terms of both performance and interpretability. The contribution of this paper is three-folds: 1) updating main parameters of classifiers based on their certainty factor in matching of incoming data, 2) enhancing essential components of XCS to be compatible with such fuzzy representation schema and 3) proposing a novel rule set reduction method named Reduction based on Least Reward Prediction (RLRP) to improve the interpretability of the evolved model. Furthermore, an inference methodology which is compatible with RLRP is suggested to maintain the similar performance. The obtained results are promising due to the effectiveness of proposed method in dealing with real world problems. Furthermore, the proposed reduction method can upgrade the interpretability of final rule set by boiling its size down by 94percent on average while slightly degrading the prediction accuracy.},

The original method intends to work for the whole continuum of Bayesian classifiers, from naive Bayes to unrestricted networks. In our experience, it performs well for low values of k. However, the algorithm tends to degrade in more complex spaces, as it greedily tries to add k dependencies to all feature nodes of the resulting net.

We try to overcome this limitation by seeking for optimal values of k on a feature per feature basis. At the same time, we look for the best feature ordering. That is, we try to estimate the joint probability distribution of optimal feature orderings and individual number of dependencies. We feel that this preserves the essence of the original algorithm, while providing notable performance improvements.},

In a multi-objective perspective, this paper combines principles from two different clustering paradigms: the connectivity principle from density-based methods is integrated into the partitional clustering approach. The standard k-Means algorithm is hybridized with Particle Swarm Optimization. The new method (PSO-kMeans) benefits from both a local and a global view on data and alleviates some drawbacks of the k-Means algorithm; thus, it is able to spot types of clusters which are otherwise difficult to obtain (elongated shapes, non-similar volumes). Our experimental results show that PSO-kMeans improves the performance of standard k-Means in all test cases and performs at least comparable to state-of-the-art methods in the worst case. PSO-kMeans is robust to outliers. This comes at a cost: the preprocessing step for finding the nearest neighbors for each data item is required, which increases the initial linear complexity of k-Means to quadratic complexity.},

 abstract = {XCSF approximates function surfaces by evolving a suitable clustering of the input space, so that a simple -- typically linear -- predictor yields sufficient accuracy in each cluster. With an increasing number of distinct output dimensions, however, the accuracy of local predictions typically decreases. We analyze the performance of a single XCSF instance and compare it to the performance of a multiple-instance XCSF, where each instance predicts one dimension of the output. We show that dependent on the problem at hand, the multiple-instance XCSF approach is highly advantageous. In particular, we show that the more local linearity structures differ, the more a modularized approximation by multiple XCSF instances pays off. In fact, if modularization is not applied, the problem complexity may increase exponentially in the number of approximately orthogonally-structured output dimensions. To relate these results also to current XCSF application options, we show that the multiple-instance XCSF approach can also be applied to the problem of learning a compact model of the Jacobian of the forward-kinematics of a seven degree of freedom anthropomorphic robot arm for inverse robot arm control in simulation.},

 abstract = {UCS is a Learning Classifier System (LCS) which evolves condition-action rules for supervised classification tasks. In UCS the fitness of a rule is based on its accuracy raised to a power , and this fitness is used in both the search for good rules (via a genetic algorithm) and in a classification vote. We trace the origin of the UCS fitness function through three successive versions of the XCS accuracy function, for which we present previously unpublished details and rationales. Through numerical examples and empirical studies we demonstrate that  tunes both selective pressure in genetic search and the voting margin in classification, and demonstrate that  (or some alternative) is necessary for both. We appeal to margin theory to explain the effect on classification and so connect the LCS field with ensemble systems, and we suggest  might be useful as a noise-correction parameter. We argue that the design of fitness functions has always been the central difficulty for Michigan LCSs and that better understanding can help both parameterisation of existing algorithms and development of new ones.},

 abstract = {Learning from unlabeled data provides innumerable advantages to a wide range of applications where there is a huge amount of unlabeled data freely available. Semi-supervised learning, which builds models from a small set of labeled examples and a potential large set of unlabeled examples, is a paradigm that may effectively use those unlabeled data. Here we propose KGP, a semi-supervised transductive genetic programming algorithm for classification. Apart from being one of the first semi-supervised algorithms, it is transductive (instead of inductive), i.e., it requires only a training dataset with labeled and unlabeled examples, which should represent the complete data domain. The algorithm relies on the three main assumptions on which semi-supervised algorithms are built, and performs both global search on labeled instances and local search on unlabeled instances. Periodically, unlabeled examples are moved to the labeled set after a weighted voting process performed by a committee. Results on eight UCI datasets were compared with Self-Training and KNN, and showed KGP as a promising method for semi-supervised learning.},

This direction of research has met with limited success due to the intractability of complicated heuristic training rules used by the learning classifier systems. In this paper, we derive a learning classifier system from a mixture of experts that is similar to a sUpervised Classifier System (UCS) in terms of its training and prediction routines. We start by framing the learning model as a mixture of experts which uses an Expectation Maximisation (EM) procedure to learn its parameters. The batch updates of the EM is then converted into online updates and finally into a GA based sampled online update thus ending up with a classifier system similar to a sUpervised Classifier System. In this paper, we show the effectiveness of such a system as compared to UCS through a series of comparative studies on test datasets.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a spiking neuro-evolutionary system which implements memristors as neuromodulatory connections, i.e. whose weights can vary during a trial. The evolutionary design process exploits parameter self-adaptation and a constructionist approach, allowing the number of neurons, connection weights, and inter-neural connectivity pattern to be evolved for each network. Additionally, each memristor has its own conductance profile, which alters the neuromodulatory behaviour of the memristor and may be altered during the application of the GA. We demonstrate that this approach allows the evolutionary process to discover beneficial memristive behaviours at specific points in the networks. We evaluate our approach against two phenomenological real-world memristive implementations, a theoretical linear memristor, and a system containing standard connections only. Performance is evaluated on a simulated robotic navigation task.},

We witnessed the inadequacy of XCS on binary problems that contain high overlap between optimal rules especially when the focus is on population and not system level performance. The literature attempts to underplay the importance of the aforementioned weakness and in short, supports that a) XCS can potentially learn any Boolean function given enough resources are allocated (right parameters used) and b) the main metric deciding the learning difficulty of a Boolean function is the amount of classifiers required to represent it (i.e. |[O]|). With this work we experimentally refuted the aforementioned propositions and as a result of the work, we introduce new insights on the behavior of XCS when solving two-valued Boolean functions using a binary reward scheme (1000/0). We also introduce a new population metric (percent[EPI]) that should necessarily be used to guide future research on improving XCS performance on the aforementioned problems.},

In this paper we propose models for the probability of having a good initial population using the Attribute List Knowledge Representation (ALKR) for discrete inputs using the GABIL encoding. We base our work in the schema and covering bound models previously proposed for XCS. The models are extended to (a) deal with the combination of ALKR+GABIL representation, (b) explicitly handle datasets with niche overlap and (c) model the impact of using covering and a default rule in the representation. The models are designed and evaluated within the framework of the BioHEL GBML system and are empirically evaluated using first boolean datasets and later also nominal datasets of higher cardinality. The models in this paper allow us to evaluate the challenges presented by problems with high cardinality (in terms of number of attributes and values of the attributes) as well as the benefits contributed by each of the components of BioHEL's representation and initialisation operators.},

This study investigates a new application of genetic programming (GP) in the field of hyper-heuristics and proposes a method called GPAM, which employs GP to evolve adaptive mechanisms (AM) to solve hard optimisation problems. The advantage of this method over other heuristic selection methods is the ability of evolved adaptive mechanisms to contain complicated combinations of heuristics and use problem solving states for heuristic selection. The method is tested on three problem domains and the results show that GPAM is very competitive when compared with existing hyper-heuristics. An analysis is also provided to gain more understanding of the proposed method.},

 abstract = {The Nelder-Mead Algorithm (NMA) is a close relative of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Differential Evolution (DE). In recent work, PSO, DE and NMA have been generalized using a formal geometric framework that treats solution representations in a uniform way. These formal algorithms can be used as templates to derive rigorously specific PSO, DE and NMA for both continuous and combinatorial spaces retaining the same geometric interpretation of the search dynamics of the original algorithms across representations. In previous work, a geometric NMA has been derived for the binary string representation and permutation representation. Furthermore, PSO and DE have already been derived for the space of genetic programs. In this paper, we continue this line of research and derive formally a specific NMA for the space of genetic programs. The result is a Nelder-Mead Algorithm searching the space of genetic programs by acting directly on their tree representation. We present initial experimental results for the new algorithm. The challenge tackled in the present work compared with earlier work is that the pair NMA and genetic programs is the most complex considered so far. This combination raises a number of issues and casts light on how algorithmic features can interact with representation features to give rise to a highly peculiar search behaviour.},

 abstract = {This paper proposes to improve the performance of Genetic Programming (GP) over unseen data by minimizing the variance of the output values of evolving models alongwith reducing error on the training data. Variance is a well understood, simple and inexpensive statistical measure; it is easy to integrate into a GP implementation and can be computed over arbitrary input values even when the target output is not known.

Moreover, we propose a simple variance based selection scheme to decide between two models (individuals). The scheme is simple because, although it uses bi-objective criteria to differentiate between two competing models, it does not rely on a multi-objective optimisation algorithm. In fact, standard multi-objective algorithms can also employ this scheme to identify good trade-offs such as those located around the knee of the Pareto Front.

The results indicate that, despite some limitations, these proposals significantly improve the performance of GP over a selection of high dimensional (multi-variate) problems from the domain of symbolic regression. This improvement is manifested by superior results over test sets in three out of four problems, and by the fact that performance over the test sets does not degrade as often witnessed with standard GP; neither is this performance ever inferior to that on the training set. As with some earlier studies, these results do not find a link between expressions of small sizes and their ability to generalise to unseen data.},

 abstract = {In this paper, an investigation of evolvable probabilistic classifiers is conducted, along with a thorough comparison between a classical Gaussian distance model, and the induction of Gaussian-to-circle projection model. The newly introduced model refers to a distance fitness measure, based on the projection of Gaussian distributions with geometric circles. The projection architecture aims to model and classify physical aggressive behaviours, by using biomechanical primitives. The primitives are being used to model the dynamics of the aggressive activities, by evolving biomechanical classifiers, which can discriminate between three behaviours and six actions. Both evolutionary models have shown strong discrimination performances on recognising the individual actions of each behaviour. From the comparison, the proposed model outperformed the classical one with three ensemble programs.},

 abstract = {This paper describes a technique which can be used with Genetic Programming (GP) to reduce implicit bias in binary classification tasks. Arbitrarily chosen class boundaries can introduce bias, but if individuals can choose their own boundaries, tailored to their function set, then their outputs are automatically scaled into a suitable range. These boundaries evolve over time as the individuals adapt to the data. Our system calculates the Evolved Class Boundary(ECB) for each individual in every generation, with the twin aims of reducing training times and improving test fitness. The method is tested on three benchmark binary classification data sets from the medical domain.

The results obtained suggest that the strategy can improve training, validation and test fitness, and can also result in smaller individuals as well as reduced training times. Our approach is compared with a standard benchmark GP system, as well as with over twenty other systems from the literature, many of which use highly tuned, non-EC methods, and is shown to yield superior results in many cases.},

 abstract = {During the development of applied systems, an important problem that must be addressed is that of choosing the correct tools for a given domain or scenario. This general task has been addressed by the genetic programming (GP) community by attempting to determine the intrinsic difficulty that a problem poses for a GP search. This paper presents an approach to predict the performance of GP applied to data classification, one of the most common problems in computer science. The novelty of the proposal is to extract statistical descriptors and complexity descriptors of the problem data, and from these estimate the expected performance of a GP classifier. We derive two types of predictive models: linear regression models and symbolic regression models evolved with GP. The experimental results show that both approaches provide good estimates of classifier performance, using synthetic and real-world problems for validation. In conclusion, this paper shows that it is possible to accurately predict the expected performance of a GP classifier using a set of descriptors that characterize the problem data.},

We compare the fitness landscapes of GP search when standard subtree mutation and arecently proposed semantic-based mutation, Semantic Similarity-based Mutation (SSM), are used. The comparison is based on two well-studied fitness landscape measures, namely, the autocorrelation function and information content. The experiments were conducted on a family of symbolic regression problems with increasing degrees of difficulty. The results show that SSM helps to significantly smooth out the fitness landscape of GP compared to standard subtree mutation. This gives an explanation for the better performance of SSM over standard subtree mutation operator.},

We investigate the role of mutation in GP, and attempt to answer questions regarding its effectiveness as a means for enhancing diversity, and the consequent effects of any such diversity promotion on the solution finding performance of the algorithm. We find that mutation can be beneficial for GP, but subject to the proviso that it be tailored to enhance particular forms of diversity.},

An embedding imposes a well-structured hypercube topology on the search space, endows it with a semantic-aware neighborhood, and enables convenient search using Cartesian coordinates. The embedding algorithm consists in locality-driven optimization and operates in abstraction from a specific fitness function, improving locality of all possible fitness landscapes simultaneously. We experimentally validate the approach on a large sample of symbolic regression tasks and show that it provides better search performance than the original program space. We demonstrate also that semantic embedding of small programs can be exploited in a compositional manner to effectively search the space of compound programs.},

In this work we revisit two bloat control methods, the old Brood Recombination and the newer Dynamic Limits, hypothesizing that together they contain the two main ingredients that make Operator Equalisation so successful. We reassemble Operator Equalisation by joining these two ingredients in a hybrid method, and test it in a hard real world regression problem. The results are surprising. Operator Equalisation and the hybrid variants exhibit completely different behaviors, and an unexpected feature of Operator Equalisation is revealed, one that may be the true responsible for its success: a nearly flat length distribution target. We support this finding with additional results, and discuss its implications.},

A multilevel genetic programming approach is presented based on a new computational multilevel selection framework [19]. This approach considers biological group selection theory to encourage cooperation, and a new cooperation operator to build solutions hierarchically. It extends evolution from individuals to multiple group levels, leading to good performance on both individuals and groups. The applicability of this approach is evaluated on 7 multi-class classification problems with different features, such as non-linearity, skewed data distribution and large feature space. The results, when compared to other cooperative evolutionary algorithms in the literature, demonstrate that this approach improves solution accuracy and consistency, and simplifies solution complexity. In addition, the problem is decomposed as a result of evolution without human interference.},

The technique is based on the use of tags that evolving programs may use to label and later to refer to code fragments. Tags may refer inexactly, permitting the labeling and use of code fragments to co-evolve in an incremental way. The technique can be implemented as a minor modification to an existing, general purpose genetic programming system, and it does not require pre-specification of the module architecture of evolved programs. We demonstrate that tag-based modules readily evolve and that this allows problem solving effort to scale well with problem size. We also show that the tag-based module technique is effective even in complex, non-uniform problem environments for which previous techniques perform poorly. We demonstrate the technique in the context of the stack-based genetic programming system PushGP, but we also briefly discuss ways in which it may be used with other kinds of genetic programming systems.},

In this work we describe an implementation: pyEDB, that encodes changes as a series of code modifications or patches. These modifications are evolved as individuals. We show pyEDB to be effective in repairing some small errors, including variable naming errors in Python programs. We also demonstrate that evolving patches rather than whole programs simplifies the removal of spurious errors.},

In this paper Grammatical Evolution is used to evolve Java programs to control a Robocode robot. This paper demonstrates how Grammatical Evolution together with spatial co-evolution in age layered planes (SCALP) can harness co-evolution to evolve relatively complex behaviour, including robots capable of beating Robocode's sample robots as well as some more complex human coded robots. The results of the co-evolution are similar to the results obtained by direct evolution against a range of human coded robots. This indicates that co-evolution alone is able to evolve robots of a similar standard to those evolved against graded human coded robots.},

 abstract = {A computational model of a double auction market is introduced and extended to allow a controlled cyclic behaviour in the price signal to be developed. Traders are evolved to maximise profit in this market using Grammatical Evolution, and their properties studied for a range of periods and amplitude of the trend in the price signal. The trader grammar allows decision making based on simple trading rules incorporating the concepts of moving-average oscillators and trading range break-out. The results of this investigation demonstrate that traders evolve a short waiting period between decisions, and that there underlying decision logic reflects the scale of the market price frequency. Evidence is presented that suggests evolving a robust profit-making trader, for a range of price frequency changes, requires the training data to have high frequency variation. More generally, to evolve robust solutions for any complex GP problem, a set of local models or an ensemble and state-based approach, is implied by the results.},

 abstract = {Estimation of Distribution Algorithms were introduced into Genetic Programming over 15 years ago, and have demonstrated good performance on a range of problems, but there has been little research into their limitations. We apply two such algorithms - scalar and vectorial Stochastic Grammar GP - to Daida's well-known Lid problem, to better understand their ability to learn specific structures. The scalar algorithm performs poorly, but the vectorial version shows good overall performance. We then extended Daida's problem to explore the vectorial algorithm's ability to find even more specific structures, finding that the performance fell off rapidly as the specificity of the required structure increased. Thus although this particular system has less severe structural difficulty issues than standard GP, it is by no means free of them. Track: Genetic Programming},

 abstract = {The NK landscapes are a well known benchmark for genetic algorithms (GAs) in which it is possible to tune the ruggedness of the fitness landscape by simply modifying the value of a parameter K. They have successfully been used in many theoretical studies, allowing researchers to discover interesting properties of the GAs dynamics in presence of rugged landscapes. A similar benchmark does not exist for genetic programming (GP) yet. Nevertheless, during the EuroGP conference debates of the last few years, the necessity of defining new benchmark problems for GP has repeatedly been expressed by a large part of the attendees. This paper is intended to fill this gap, by introducing an extension of the NK landscapes to tree based GP, that we call K landscapes. In this benchmark, epistasis are expressed as growing mutual interactions between the substructures of a tree as the parameter K increases. The fact that the problem becomes more and more difficult as the value of K increases is experimentally demonstrated. Interestingly, we also show that GP bloats more and more as K increases.},

It is shown that this method can evolve robots for a given task. Additionally it is demonstrated how the performance of evolved robots can be significantly improved by allowing recurrent connections within the underlying CPPNs. The resulting robots are analyzed in the hopes of answering why these recurrent connections prove to be so beneficial in this domain.

 abstract = {A challenging goal of generative and developmental systems (GDS) is to effectively evolve neural networks as complex and capable as those found in nature. Two key properties of neural structures in nature are regularity and modularity. While HyperNEAT has proven capable of generating neural network connectivity patterns with regularities, its ability to evolve modularity remains in question. This paper investigates how altering the traditional approach to determining whether connections are expressed in HyperNEAT influences modularity. In particular, an extension is introduced called a Link Expression Output (HyperNEAT-LEO) that allows HyperNEAT to evolve the pattern of weights independently from the pattern of connection expression. Because HyperNEAT evolves such patterns as functions of geometry, important general topographic principles for organizing connectivity can be seeded into the initial population. For example, a key topographic concept in nature that encourages modularity is locality, that is, components of a module are located near each other. As experiments in this paper show, by seeding HyperNEAT with a bias towards local connectivity implemented through the LEO, modular structures arise naturally. Thus this paper provides an important clue to how an indirect encoding of network structure can be encouraged to evolve modularity.},

However, the new representation is also two-dimensional and it allows evolution and development to have more ways to solve a given problem.

The Artificial Gene Regulatory (ARN) model, proposed by Wolfgang Banzhaf was one of the first tentatives. Following his seminal work some variants were proposed with increased capabilities. In this paper, we present another modification of this model, consisting in the use the regulatory network as a computational device where feedback edges are used.

 abstract = {We have developed a novel method to grow neural networks according to an inherited set of production rules (the genotype), inspired by Lindenmayer systems. In the first phase (neurogenesis), the neurons proliferate in three-dimensional space by cell division, and differentiate in function, according to the production rules. In the second phase (synaptogenesis), axons emerge from the neurons and seek out connection targets. Part of each production rule is an augmented Reverse Polish Notation expression; this permits regulation of the applicable rules, as well as introduction of spatial and temporal context to the developmental process. We connect each network to a (fixed) robotic body with a set of input sensors and muscle actuators. The robot is placed in a physically simulated environment and controlled by its network for a certain time, receiving a fitness score according to its behavior (the phenotype). Mutations are introduced into offspring by making changes to their sets of production rules. This paper introduces the L-brain developmental method, and describes our first experiments with it, which produced controllers for robotic spiders with the ability to gallop, and to follow a compass heading.},

 abstract = {In this paper we introduce the Developmental Symbolic Encoding (DSE), a new generative encoding for evolving networks (e.g. neural or boolean). DSE combines elements of two powerful generative encodings, Cellular Encoding and HyperNEAT, in order to evolve networks that are modular, regular, scale-free, and scalable. Generating networks with these properties is important because they can enhance performance and evolvability. We test DSE's ability to generate scale-free and modular networks by explicitly rewarding these properties and seeing whether evolution can produce networks that possess them. We compare the networks DSE evolves to those of HyperNEAT. The results show that both encodings can produce scale-free networks, although DSE performs slightly, but significantly, better on this objective. DSE networks are far more modular than HyperNEAT networks. Both encodings produce regular networks. We further demonstrate that individual DSE genomes during development can scale up a network pattern to accommodate different numbers of inputs. We also compare DSE to HyperNEAT on a pattern recognition problem. DSE significantly outperforms HyperNEAT, suggesting that its potential lay not just in the properties of the networks it produces, but also because it can compete with leading encodings at solving challenging problems. These preliminary results imply that DSE is an interesting new encoding worthy of additional study. The results also raise questions about which network properties are more likely to be produced by different types of generative encodings.},

We subsequently report results of a set of experiments designed to check that (1) synaptic plasticity can help a GDS to fine-tune synaptic weights and (2) that with the investigated generative encoding (EvoNeuro), only a few learning scenarios are necessary to evolve a general learning system, which can adapt itself to reward-based scenarios not tested during the fitness evaluation.},

Iterated ES-HyperNEAT, introduced in this paper, helps to reduce computational costs by focusing the search on a sequence of two-dimensional cross-sections of the hypercube and therefore makes possible searching the hypercube at a finer resolution. A series of experiments and an analysis of the evolved networks show for the first time that iterated ES-HyperNEAT not only matches but outperforms original HyperNEAT in more complex domains because ES-HyperNEAT can evolve networks with limited connectivity, elaborate on existing network structure, and compensate for movement of information within the hypercube.},

 abstract = {This paper proposes a parallel ant colony optimization (ACO) for solving quadratic assignment problems (QAPs) on a graphics processing unit (GPU) by combining tabu (TS) with ACO in CUDA (ompute unified device architecture). In TS for QAP, all neighbor moves are tested. These moves form two groups based on computing of move cost. In one group, the computing of cost is O(1) and in the other group, the computing of move cost is O(n). We compute these two groups of moves in parallel by assigning the computations to threads of CUDA. In this assignment, we propose an efficient method which we call Move-Cost Adjusted Thread Assignment (MATA). The results with GPU computation with MATA show a promising speedup compared to computation with the CPU. It is also shown that MATA is effective in applying 2-opt local search.},

In order to achieve this high degree of parallelism we implement a collaborative multi-swarm PSO algorithm on the GPU which relies on the use of many swarms rather than just one. We choose to apply our PSO algorithm against a real-world application: the task matching problem in a heterogeneous distributed computing environment. Due to the potential for large problem sizes with high dimensionality, the task matching problem proves to be very thorough in testing the GPUs capabilities for handling PSO. Our results show that the GPU offers a high degree of performance and achieves a maximum of 37 times speedup over a sequential implementation when the problem size in terms of tasks is large and many swarms are used.},

This paper describes a parallel shared-memory version of the DAEYAHSP planning system using the OpenMP directive-based API. The parallelization scheme applies at a high level of abstraction and thus can be used by any evolutionary algorithm implemented with the Evolving Objects framework. The proof of concept is validated on a 48-core machine with two planning tasks extracted from the last international planning competition. Experiments show significant speedups with an increasing number of cores. This preliminary work opens an avenue for parallelizing any evolutionary algorithm developed with EO that would target multicore architectures.},

We applied the algorithm on a multi-modal optimization problem and we focused our study on convergence time and diversity of the solutions. Using as algorithms' underlying structure different network models we studied the relationship between algorithm dynamic, i.e. convergence time, first hitting time and number of distinct optima found during the evolution, and networks' characteristics. A comparison with a panmictic evolutionary algorithm is made to study the effects of the introduction of a structure in the mating dynamics, resulting in an enhancement of diversity and containing the convergence time and first hitting time overhead. The results on the proposed multi-modal combinatorial optimization problem using regular graphs and Watts-Strogatz networks show that the underlying network characteristics clearly influences algorithm dynamics and diversity of the solutions found.},

 abstract = {Island models are popular ways of parallelizing evolutionary algorithms as they can decrease the parallel running time at low communication costs and lead to an increased population diversity. This in particular provides a good setting for crossover as this operator relies on a good diversity between parents. We consider the effect of recombining migrants with individuals on the target island. We rigorously prove, for a test function in pseudo-Boolean optimization, exponential performance gaps between island models with strongly connected topologies and a panmictic (mu+1)-EA as long as the migration interval is not too small. We then choose vertex cover as a classical NP-hard problem. By considering instances with a clear building block structure we prove that, also in this more practical setting, island models with a particular topology drastically outperform panmictic populations. Both the theoretical and empirical results show that for strongly connected topologies, such as ring, the performance drops by decreasing the migration interval, while this is not the case for topologies connected weakly such as the single receiver model.},

In this paper we describe how such a service commercialized by Dropbox is used for pool-based evolutionary algorithms. A prototype system is described and its peformance measured over a deceptive combinatorial optimization problem, finding that, for some type of problems and using commodity hardware, cloud storage systems can profitably be used as a platform for distributed evolutionary algorithms.

The best results were achieved by a mono-objective Memetic Algorithm (MA). In order to reduce the execution time, it was parallelised using an island-based model. High quality results were obtained for the proposed instance. However, subsequent studies concluded that stagnation may occur for other instances. The term multiobjectivisation refers to the transformation of originally mono-objective problems as multi-objective ones. Its main aim is to avoid local optima. In this work, a multiobjectivised MA has been applied to the gecco 2008 Bin Packing Problem. Several multiobjectivisation schemes, which use problem-dependent and problem-independent information have been tested. Also, a parallelisation of the multiobjectivised MA has been developed. Results have been compared with the best up to date mono-objective approaches. Computational results have demonstrated the validity of the proposals. They have provided benefits in terms of solution quality, and in terms of time saving.},

 abstract = {Traditionally, a genetic algorithm is used to analyze networks by maximizing the modularity (Q) measure to create a favorable community. A coevolutionary algorithm is used here to not only find the appropriate community division for a network, but to find interesting networks containing substantial changes in data within a very large network space. The network is one of the largest, if not the largest, analyzed by evolutionary computation techniques to date and is created using a real world data set consisting of fisheries catch data in the north Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Canada. This work examines the quantitative performance of two types of coevolutionary algorithms against both a standard GA that uses a natural (but not necessarily optimal) division of the data set into communities, and simulated annealing. The goal for all search algorithms was to automatically find anomalies (differences in catch) within the data. To measure practical usefulness of the system, a fisheries expert analyzed the best networks located by the search algorithms using an existing visualization software prototype. The expert indicated that a refined version of coevolutionary GA known as PAMDGA was found to most reliably locate subnetworks containing catch differences of biological relevance.},

 abstract = {The study of complex networks has received an enormous amount of attention from the scientific community in recent years. In this paper, we propose a multi-objective approach, named NNIA-Net, to discover communities in networks by employing Non-dominated Neighbor Immune Algorithm (NNIA). Our algorithm optimizes two objectives to find communities in networks' groups of vertices within which connections are dense, but between which connections are sparser. The method can produce a series of solutions which represent various divisions to the networks at different hierarchical levels. The number of subdivisions is automatically determined by the non-dominated individuals resulting from our algorithm. We demonstrate that our algorithm is highly efficient at discovering quality community structure in both synthetic and real-world network data. What's more, a new initialization method is proposed to improve the traditional initialization method by about 30percent in running time.},

The choice of appropriate design parameters, allowing the realization of such interconnections, is a complicated task. We present an evolutionary algorithm that is able to find these parameters. We describe the parallel execution of that algorithm and present optimization results.},

 abstract = {In this article we propose to couple reputation systems for wireless sensor networks with a genetic algorithm in order to improve their time of response to adversarial activities. The reputation of each node is assigned by an unsupervised genetic algorithm trained for detecting outliers in the data. The response of the system consists in assigning low reputation values to the compromised nodes cutting them off from the rest of the network. The genetic algorithm uses the feature extraction process that does not capture the properties of the attacks, but rather relies on the existing temporal and spatial redundancy in sensor networks and tries to detect temporal and spatial inconsistencies in the sequences of sensed values and the routing paths used to forward these values to the base station. This solution offers many benefits: scalable solution, fast response to thwart activities, ability to detect unknown attacks, high adaptability, and high ability in detecting and confining attacks. Comparing to the standard clustering algorithms, the benefit of this one is that it is not necessary to assign the number of clusters from the beginning. The solution is also robust to both parameter changes and the presence of large amounts of malicious data in the training and testing datasets.},

 abstract = {Evolutionary computation generally aims to create the optimal individual which represents optimal action rules when it is applied to agent systems. Genetic Network Programming (GNP) has been proposed as one of the graph-based evolutionary computations in order to create optimal individuals. GNP with rule accumulation is an extended algorithm of GNP, which extracts a large number of rules throughout the generations and stores them in rule pools, which is different from general evolutionary computations. Concretely, the individuals of GNP with rule accumulation are regarded as evolving rule generators in the training phase and the generated rules in the rule pools are actually used for decision making. In this paper, GNP with rule accumulation is enhanced in terms of its rule extraction and classification abilities for generating stock trading signals considering up and down trends and occurrence frequency of specific buying/selling timing. A large number of buying and selling rules are extracted by the individuals evolved in the training period. Then, a unique classification mechanism is used to appropriately determine whether to buy or sell stocks based on the extracted rules. In the testing simulations, the stock trading is carried out using the extracted rules and it is confirmed that the rule-based trading model shows higher profits than the conventional individual-based trading model.},

We investigate the use of a linear genetic programming (LGP) system that combines GP signals provided over multiple intraday time frames to produce one trading action. Four combinations of time frames stretching further into the past are examined. Two different decision mechanisms for evaluating the overall signal given the GP signals over all time frames are also examined, one based on majority vote and another based on temporal proximity to the buying decision. Results indicated that majority vote outperformed emphasis on proximity of time frames to the current trading decision. Analyses also indicated that longer time frame combinations were more conservative and outperformed shorter combinations for both overall upward and downward price trends.},

 abstract = {This paper looks at the real world problem of statistical disclosure control. National Statistics Agencies are required to publish detailed statistics and simultaneously guarantee the confidentiality of the contributors. When published statistical tables contain magnitude data such as turnover or health statistics the preferred method is to suppress the values of cells which may reveal confidential information. However suppressing these 'primary' cells alone will not guarantee protection due the presence of margin (row/column) totals and therefore other 'secondary' cells must also be suppressed. A previously developed algorithm that hybridizes linear programming with a genetic algorithm has been shown to protect tables with up to 40,000 cells, however Statistical Agencies are often required to protect tables with over 100,000 cells.

This algorithm's performance highly depended on the choice of mutation operator so firstly this dependency was removed. As the algorithm is unable to protect larger tables due to the time it takes for its fitness function (a linear program) to execute a series of modifications have been applied. These modifications significantly reduced its execution time which in turn greatly extend the capabilities of the hybrid algorithm to the point that it can now protect tables with up to one million cells.},

 abstract = {Most research on Strip Packing and Cutting Stock problems are focused on single-objective formulations of the problems. However, in this work we deal with more general and practical variants of the problems, which not only seeks to optimise the usage of the raw material, but also the overall production process.The problems target the cutting of a large rectangle in a set of smaller rectangles using orthogonal guillotine cuts. Common approaches are based in the minimisation of the strip length required to cut the whole set of demanded pieces (for strip problems) and in the maximisation of the total profit obtained from the available surface (for cutting stock problems). In this work we also deal with an extra objective which seeks to minimise the number of cuts involved in the cutting process, thus maximising the efficiency of the global production process. In order to obtain solutions to these problems, we have applied some of the most-known multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, since they have shown a promising behaviour when tackling multi-objective real-world problems. We have designed and implemented hyperheuristic-based encodings as an alternative to combine heuristics in such a way that a heuristic's strengths make up for the drawbacks of another.},

 abstract = {Many real world problems have a structure where small problem instances are embedded within large problem instances, or where solution quality for large problem instances is loosely correlated to that of small problem instances. This structure can be exploited because smaller problem instances typically have smaller search spaces and are cheaper to evaluate. We present an evolutionary algorithm, INCREA, which is designed to incrementally solve a large, noisy, computationally expensive problem by deriving its initial population through recursively running itself on problem instances of smaller sizes. The INCREA algorithm also expands and shrinks its population each generation and cuts off work that doesn't appear to promise a fruitful result. For further efficiency, it addresses noisy solution quality efficiently by focusing on resolving it for small, potentially reusable solutions which have a much lower cost of evaluation. We compare INCREA to a general purpose evolutionary algorithm and find that in most cases INCREA arrives at the same solution in significantly less time.},

This paper studies a problem faced by a 3PL operating a warehouse in Shanghai, China, under contract with a major company for children's clothing based in the United States. The problem involves the allocation of textile parcel shipments at the warehouse to shipping routes with different destination ports, where the shipments are destined for different retail stores. The shipments must be loaded into containers of varying sizes and costs, and the objective is to find an allocation that minimizes the total container transportation and parcel delivery costs. We formulate the problem into an integer linear programming model, and also propose a genetic algorithm approach to solve the problem practically. A demonstration of a good solution to this problem was a decisive factor in the awarding of the contract to the 3PL in question.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a modular framework for meta-heuristic optimization of complex optimization tasks by decomposing them into subtasks that may be designed and developed separately. Since these subtasks are generally correlated, a separate optimization is prohibited and the framework has to be capable of optimizing the subtasks concurrently. For this purpose, a distinction of genetic representation (genotype) and representation of a solution of the optimization problem (phenotype) is imposed. A compositional genotype and appropriate operators enable the separate development and testing of the optimization of subtasks by a strict decoupling. The proposed concept is implemented as open source reference OPT4J [6]. The architecture of this implementation is outlined and design decisions are discussed that enable a maximal decoupling and flexibility. A case study of a complex real-world optimization problem from the automotive domain is introduced. This case study requires the concurrent optimization of several heterogeneous aspects. Exemplary, it is shown how the proposed framework allows to efficiently optimize this complex problem by decomposing it into subtasks that are optimized concurrently.},

Additionally, the placement of Through-Silicon-Vias (TSVs) for connecting different layers is one of the key issues in 3D technology. Although a few recent works have considered thermal-aware placement of cores in chip multi-processor architectures, the concepts of 3D and TSVs have not been conveniently incorporated. Therefore, new suitable exploration methods for the 3D thermal-aware floorplaning problem need to be developed. In this paper we analyze the benefits of two different exploration techniques for the floorplanning problem: Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) and a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP). We present a novel algorithm that uses MILP to minimize average temperature in the 3D chip, whereas uses MOGA to insert TSVs, connecting the layers while the total wire length is minimized. Our experiments with two different 3D chips show that our algorithm achieves 10percent reduction in the maximum temperature and thermal gradient.},

 abstract = {Wave energy converters promise to be a viable alternative to current electrical generation methods. However, these generators must become more efficient before wide-scale industrial use can become cost-effective. The efficiency of these devices is primarily dependent upon their geometry and ballast configuration which are both difficult to evaluate, due to slow computation time and high computation cost of current models. In this paper, we use evolutionary algorithms to optimize the ballast geometry of a wave energy generator using a two step process. First, we generate a function approximator (neural network) to predict wave energy converter power output with respect to key geometric design variables. This is a critical step as the computation time of using a full model (e.g., AQWA) to predict energy output prohibits the use of an evolutionary algorithm for design optimization. The function approximator reduced the computation time by over 99percent while having an average error of only 1.5percent. The evolutionary algorithm then optimized the weight distribution of a wave energy generator, resulting in an 84percent improvement in power output over a ballast-free wave energy converter.},

In this paper we propose a direct optimization approach to the P300 classification problem. A general formulation of the problem is introduced. Different classes of optimization algorithms are applied to solve the problem and the concepts of k-best and k-worst ensembles of solutions are introduced as a way to improve the accuracy of single solutions.

 abstract = {This paper proposes a novel method for using the service (field failure) data of consumer vehicles to estimate customer perception. To achieve this, relevant variables are extracted from the vehicle service data and provided as input to the proposed algorithm which then comes up with an optimized mathematical model for predicting the Customer Satisfaction Index or CSI. The methodology is then extended in a way that allows comparison of the CSIs of two or more vehicle models, thus providing a measure of the market's perceived quality of a vehicle model relative to another. Validation against the Consumer Reports data shows that customer experiences and their consequent response in surveys are indeed a reflection of the numbers the service data provides. However, it is argued that the proposed model is more generic than the Consumer Reports because: (1) it doesn't rely on consumer surveys and (2) it can be used to assess individual consumer level satisfaction.},

 abstract = {Learning a ranking function is important for numerous tasks such as information retrieval (IR), question answering, and product recommendation. For example, in information retrieval, a Web search engine is required to rank and return a set of documents relevant to a query issued by a user. We propose RankDE, a ranking method that uses differential evolution (DE) to learn a ranking function to rank a list of documents retrieved by a Web search engine. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed method is the first DE-based approach to learn a ranking function for IR. We evaluate the proposed method using LETOR dataset, a standard benchmark dataset for training and evaluating ranking functions for IR. In our experiments, the proposed method significantly outperforms previously proposed rank learning methods that use evolutionary computation algorithms such as Particle Swam Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Programming (GP), achieving a statistically significant mean average precision (MAP) of 0.339 on TD2003 dataset and 0.430 on the TD2004 dataset. Moreover, the proposed method shows comparable results to the state-of-the-art non-evolutionary computational approaches on this benchmark dataset. We analyze the feature weights learnt by the proposed method to better understand the salient features for the task of learning to rank for information retrieval.},

Besides the fact that these models need more and relatively expensive material data input, a problem is still the reliable fit of all necessary parameters. For the steel grade DX54, an interaction of strain rate and yield locus has been identified, finally leading to different material model calibrations. An even better accuracy of feasibility studies is promoted by using advanced yield locus models for forming simulations. With a new set of specially designed experiments in combination with evolutionary strategies, inverse material parameter identification is realized through minimization of a nonlinear error function. This approach defines a new and powerful method for selection and validation of the adequate material model for industrial simulation.},

In this paper, we first analyze the role of SMS spam as an increasing threat to mobile and smart phone users. Afterward, we present a filtering method for controlling SMS spam on the access layer of mobile devices. We analyze the role of different evolutionary and non evolutionary classifiers for our spam filter by assimilating the byte-level features of SMS. We evaluated our framework on real-world benign and spam datasets collected from Grumbletext and the users in our social networking community. The results of carefully designed experiments demonstrated that the evolutionary classifiers, like the Structural Learning Algorithm in Vague Environment (SLAVE), could efficiently detect spam messages at the access layer of a mobile device. To the best of our knowledge, the current work is the first SMS spam filter based on evolutionary classifier that works on the access layer of a mobile device. The results of our experiments show that our framework, using evolutionary algorithms, achieves a detection accuracy of more than 93percent, with false alarm rate of 0.13$percent in classifying spam SMS. Moreover, the memory requirement for incorporating SMS features is relatively small, and it takes less than one second to classify a message as spam or benign.},

 abstract = {In recent years, we have witnessed the dramatic increase in the volume of mobile SMS (Short Messaging Service) spam. The reason is that operators - owing to fierce market competition - have introduced packages that allow their customers to send unlimited SMS in less than $1 a month. It not only degrades the service of cellular operators but also compromises security and privacy of users. In this paper, we analyze SMS spam to identify novel features that distinguishes it from benign SMS (ham). The novelty of our approach is that we intercept the SMS at the access layer of a mobile phone - in hexadecimal format - and extract two features: (1) octet bigrams, and (2) frequency distribution of octets. Later, we provide these features to a number of evolutionary and non-evolutionary classifiers to identify the best classifier for our mobile spam filtering system. We evaluate the detection rate and false alarm rate of our system - using different classifiers - on a real world dataset. The results of our experiments show that sUpervised Classifier System (UCS), by operating on the the above-mentioned features'set, achieves more than 89percent detection rate and 0percent false alarm rate.},

A common application of molecular docking is in drug discovery where a large number of ligands are docked against a protein to identify potential drug candidates. This is a computationally intensive problem especially if flexibility of the molecules are taken into account. In this paper we show how MolDock, which is a high accuracy method for flexible molecular docking using a variant of differential evolution, can be parallelised on both CPU and GPU. The methods presented for parallelising the workload result in an average speedup of 3.9x on a 4-core CPU and 27.4x on a comparable CUDA enabled GPU when docking 133 ligands of different sizes. Furthermore, the presented parallelisation schemes are generally applicable and can easily be adapted to other common flexible docking methods.},

This paper summarizes proof-of-concept research activity aimed at developing a physical layer Radio Frequency (RF) air monitoring capability to limit unauthorized WAP access and improve network security. This is done using Differential Evolution (DE) to optimize the performance of a Learning from Signals (LFS) classifier implemented with RF Distinct Native Attribute (RF-DNA) fingerprints. Performance of the resultant DE-optimized LFS classifier is demonstrated using 802.11a WiFi devices under the most challenging conditions of intra-manufacturer classification, i.e., using emissions of like-model devices that only differ in serial number. Using identical classifier input features, performance of the DE-optimized LFS classifier is assessed relative to a Multiple Discriminant Analysis / Maximum Likelihood (MDA/ML) classifier that has been used for previous demonstrations. The comparative assessment is made using both Time Domain (TD) and Spectral Domain (SD) fingerprint features. For all combinations of classifier type, feature type, and signal-to-noise ratio considered, results show that the DE-optimized LFS classifier with TD features is superior and provides up to 20percent improvement in classification accuracy with proper selection of DE parameters.},

 abstract = {The dynamic memory manager (DMM) is a key element whose customization for a target application reports great benefits in terms of execution time, memory usage and energy consumption. Previous works presented algorithms to automatically obtain custom DMMs for a given application. Nevertheless, those approaches are based on grammatical evolution where the fitness is built as an aggregate objective function, which does not completely exploit the search space, returning the designer the DMM solution with best fitness. However, this approach may not find solutions that could fit in a concrete hardware platform due to a very low value of one of the objectives while the others remain high, which may represent a high fitness. In this work we present the first multi-objective optimization methodology applied to DMM optimization where the Pareto dominance is considered, thus providing the designer with a set of non-dominated DMM implementations on each optimization run. Our results show that the multi-objective optimization provides Pareto-optimal alternatives due to a better exploitation of the search space obtaining better hypervolume values than the aggregate objective function approach.},

 abstract = {This paper presents an evaluation of the benefits of multi-objective optimisation algorithms, compared to single objective optimisation algorithms, when applied to the problem of planning a route over an unstructured environment, where a route has a number of objectives defined using real-world data sources. The paper firstly introduces the problem of planning a route over an unstructured environment (one where no pre-determined set of possible routes exists) and identifies the data sources, Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED) and NASA Landsat Hyperspectral data, used to calculate the route objectives (time taken, exposure and fuel consumed). A number of different route planning problems are then used to compare the performance of two single-objective optimisation algorithms and a range of multi-objective optimisation algorithms selected from the literature.

The experimental results show that the multi-objective optimisation algorithms result in significantly better routes than the single-objective optimisation algorithms and have the advantage of returning a set of routes that represent the trade-off between objectives. The MOEA/D and SMPSO algorithms are shown, in these experiments, to outperform the other multi-objective optimisation algorithms for this type of problem. Future work will focus on how these algorithms can be integrated into a route planning tool and especially on reducing the time taken to produce routes.},

 abstract = {Radar system design and optimization are complex problems recently cast in the framework of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. However, in the problem of counter radar detection and tracking, the state-of-the-art multi-objective optimization algorithm NSGA-II is unable to span the complete 2D Pareto front of the asymptotic and convex problem domain, leaving out vital information on the radar-jammer system dynamics. Common modifications to the domination principle employed will to some degree increase the span of the Pareto front, at the expense of slower convergence and a less dense front. In this paper, the new Surface Evolutionary Algorithm (SEA) is introduced to overcome these problems. The SEA characterizes all solutions by one single metric and uses interpolated attraction points along the boundary of the solution set as basis for selecting and evolving solutions in the optimizer. The SEA is proposed and analyzed in the context of the conflicting multi-objective optimization criteria of search efficiency, density distribution and span of the complete Pareto front of the counter radar detection problem. The SEA is shown to produce high performance solutions not easily obtained using the well-established optimization methods of NSGA-II and e-MOEA.},

 abstract = {This paper is concerned with the determination of optimum forces extracted by robot grippers on the surface of a grasped rigid object -- a matter which is crucial to guarantee the stability of the grip without causing defect or damage to the grasped object. A multi-criteria optimization of robot gripper design problem is solved with two different configurations involving two conflicting objectives and a number of constraints. The objectives involve minimization of the difference between maximum and minimum gripping forces and simultaneous minimization of the transmission ratio between the applied gripper actuator force and the force experienced at the gripping ends. Two different configurations of the robot gripper are designed by a state-of-the-art algorithm (NSGA-II) and the obtained results are compared with a previous study. Due to presence of geometric constraints, the resulting optimization problem is highly non-linear and multi-modal. For both gripper configurations, the proposed methodology outperforms the results of the previous study. The Pareto-optimal solutions are thoroughly investigated to establish some meaningful relationships between the objective functions and variable values. In addition, it is observed that one of the gripper configurations completely outperforms the other one from the point of view of both objectives, thereby establishing a complete bias towards the use of one of the configurations in practice.},

 abstract = {Manually creating test cases is time consuming and error prone. Search-based software testing can help automate this process and thus reduce time and effort and increase quality by automatically generating relevant test cases. Previous research has mainly focused on static programming languages and simple test data inputs such as numbers. This is not practical for dynamic programming languages that are increasingly used by software developers. Here we present an approach for search-based software testing for dynamically typed programming languages that can generate test scenarios and both simple and more complex test data. The approach is implemented as a tool, RuTeG, in and for the dynamic programming language Ruby. It combines an evolutionary search for test cases that give structural code coverage with a learning component to restrict the space of possible types of inputs. The latter is called for in dynamic languages since we cannot always know statically which types of objects are valid inputs. Experiments on 14 cases taken from real-world Ruby projects show that RuTeG achieves full or higher statement coverage on more cases and does so faster than randomly generated test cases.},

 abstract = {During the inter-class test, a common problem, named Class Integration and Test Order (CITO) problem, involves the determination of a test class order that minimizes stub creation effort, and consequently test costs. The approach based on Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) has achieved promising results because it allows the use of different factors and measures that can affect the stubbing process. Many times these factors are in conflict and usually there is no a single solution for the problem. Existing works on MOEAs present some limitations. The approach was evaluated with only two coupling measures, based on the number of attributes and methods of the stubs to be created. Other MOEAs can be explored and also other coupling measures. Considering this fact, this paper investigates the performance of two evolutionary algorithms: NSGA-II and SPEA2, for the CITO problem with four coupling measures (objectives) related to: attributes, methods, number of distinct return types and distinct parameter types. An experimental study was performed with four real systems developed in Java. The obtained results point out that the MOEAs can be efficiently used to solve this problem with several objectives, achieving solutions with balanced compromise between the measures, and of minimal effort to test.},

 abstract = {Traditionally, simulation has been used by project managers in optimising decision making. However, current simulation packages only include simulation optimisation which considers a single objective (or multiple objectives combined into a single fitness function). This paper aims to describe an approach that consists of using multiobjective optimisation techniques via simulation in order to help software project managers find the best values for initial team size and schedule estimates for a given project so that cost, time and productivity are optimised. Using a System Dynamics (SD) simulation model of a software project, the sensitivity of the output variables regarding productivity, cost and schedule using different initial team size and schedule estimations is determined. The generated data is combined with a well-known multiobjective optimisation algorithm, NSGA-II, to find optimal solutions for the output variables. The NSGA-II algorithm was able to quickly converge to a set of optimal solutions composed of multiple and conflicting variables from a medium size software project simulation model. Multiobjective optimisation and SD simulation modeling are complementary techniques that can generate the Pareto front needed by project managers for decision making. Furthermore, visual representations of such solutions are intuitive and can help project managers in their decision making process.},

In the SPS problem, the total budget and human resources involved in software development must be optimally managed in order to end up with a successful project. Companies are mainly concerned with reducing both the duration and the cost of the projects, and these two goals are in conflict with each other. A multi-objective approach is therefore the natural way of facing the SPS problem. In this paper, a number of multi-objective metaheuristics have been used to address this problem. They have been thoroughly compared over a set of 36 publicly available instances that cover a wide range of different scenarios. The resulting project schedulings of the algorithms have been analyzed in order to show their relevant features. The algorithms used in this paper and the analysis performed may assist project managers in the difficult task of deciding who does what in a software project.},

 abstract = {Model checking is an automatic technique that exhaustively checks the state space of a system/program to prove if a specification is satisfied. If an error is detected, the precise circumstances of the issue are returned to the user in the form of a counterexample. Exhaustively checking the state space of a large system, a system with many concurrent components for example, is often intractable. In this scenario, heuristic mechanisms can be employed with the task of detecting errors rather than proving the system is correct. Recently, a metaheuristic EDA-based approach to detecting deadlock in multithreaded Java software has shown great promise in this area. In this paper, we extend that work to search Promela models for counterexamples. We show that the EDA-based technique can find errors where algorithms such as A* search fail. We also show the ability of the EDA to find shorter errors than those discovered by traditional heuristic methods.},

 abstract = {The Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm is an efficient and powerful evolutionary algorithm (EA) for solving optimization problems. However the success of DE in solving a specific problem is closely related to appropriately choosing its control parameters. Parameter tuning leads to additional computational costs because of time-consuming trial-and-error tests. Self-adaptation, in contrast, allows the algorithm to reconfigure itself, automatically adapting to the problem being solved. There are in the literature some self-adaptive versions of differential evolution, however they do not align completely with self-adaptation concepts. In this paper, some self-adaptive versions of DE in the literature are described and discussed, and then a new Self-Adaptive Differential Evolution with multiple mutation strategies is proposed; it is called Self-adaptive Mutation Differential Evolution (SaMDE) and aims at preserving the essential characteristics of self-adaptation. Some computational experiments which illustrate algorithm behaviour and a comparative test with the classical DE and with an important self-adaptive DE are presented. The results suggest that SaMDE is a very promising algorithm.},

DAMS is dedicated to adaptive optimization in distributed environments. Given a set of metaheuristics, the goal of DAMS is to coordinate their local execution on distributed nodes in order to optimize the global performance of the distributed system. DAMS is based on three-layer architecture allowing nodes to decide distributively what local information to communicate, and what metaheuristic to apply while the optimization process is in progress. SBM is a simple, yet efficient, adaptive distributed algorithm using an exploitation component allowing nodes to select the metaheuristic with the best locally observed performance, and an exploration component allowing nodes to detect the metaheuristic with the actual best performance. SBM features are analyzed from both a parallel and an adaptive point of view, and its efficiency is demonstrated through experimentations and comparisons with other adaptive strategies (sequential and distributed).},

We generalize AP by allowing any target distribution to be pursued for operator selection probabilities. We call this the generalized adaptive pursuit algorithm (GAPA). We show that the probability matching and multi-armed bandit strategies, with particular settings, can be integrated in the GAPA framework. We propose and experimentally test two instances of GAPA. Assuming that there are multiple useful operators, the multi-operator AP pursues them all simultaneously. The multi-layer AP is intended to scale up the pursuit algorithm to a large set of operators. To experimentally test the proposed GAPA instances, we introduce the adaptive genetic Pareto local search (aGPLS) that selects on-line genetic operators to restart the Pareto local search. We show on a bi-objective Quadratic assignment problem (bQAP) instance with a large number of facilities and high correlation that aGPLSs are the algorithms with best performance tested.},

 abstract = {We consider an optimization scenario in which resources are required in the evaluation process of candidate solutions. The challenge we are focussing on is that certain resources have to be committed to for some period of time whenever they are used by an optimizer. This has the effect that certain solutions may be temporarily non-evaluable during the optimization. Previous analysis revealed that evolutionary algorithms (EAs) can be effective against this resourcing issue when augmented with static strategies for dealing with non-evaluable solutions, such as repairing, waiting, or penalty methods. Moreover, it is possible to select a suitable strategy for resource-constrained problems offline if the resourcing issue is known in advance. In this paper we demonstrate that an EA that uses a reinforcement learning (RL) agent, here Sarsa(lambda), to learn offline when to switch between static strategies, can be more effective than any of the static strategies themselves. We also show that learning the same task as the RL agent but online using an adaptive strategy selection method, here D-MAB, is not as effective; nevertheless, online learning is an alternative to static strategies.},

Its main feature is to consider the whole evaluated solutions of a neutral network rather than the last accepted solution. Moreover, VEGAS is designed to escape from plateaus based on the evolvability of solutions, and on a multi-armed bandit by selecting the more promising solution from the neutral network. Experiments are conducted on NK-landscapes with neutrality. Results show the importance of considering the whole identified solutions from the neutral network and of guiding the search explicitly. The impact of the level of neutrality and of the exploration-exploitation trade-off are deeply analyzed.},

Using a common software interface (the HyFlex framework), the proposed algorithms are tested across four hard combinatorial optimisation problems: permutation flow shop, 1D bin packing, maximum satisfiability, and personnel scheduling (including instance data from real-world industrial applications). Using the HyFlex framework, exactly the same high level search strategy can be applied to all the domains and instances. Our results confirm that the adaptive variants outperform a baseline iterated local search with uniform random selection of the move operators. We argue that the adaptive algorithms proposed are general yet powerful, and contribute to the goal of increasing the generality and applicability of heuristic search.},

The framework TDM (Tuned Data Mining) was developed to facilitate the search for good parameters and the comparison of different tuners. It is shown that tuning is of great importance for high-quality results. Surrogate-model based tuning using the Sequential Parameter Optimization Toolbox (SPOT) is compared with other tuners (CMA-ES, BFGS, LHD) and evidence is found that SPOT is well suited for this task. In benchmark tasks like the Data Mining Cup (DMC) tuned models achieve remarkably better ranks than their untuned counterparts.},

The associated decisions can be based on an index policy in which each decision option is independently given a value and the highest value choice is selected. In this paper, we represent such heuristics for online bin packing as a simple matrix of scores. We then use a genetic algorithm to search for matrices giving good performance. This might be regarded as parameter tuning of the packing heuristic but in which a fine-grained representation is used and so the number of parameters is much larger than in standard parameter tuning. The evolved matrices perform better than the standard heuristics. They also reveal interesting structures and so have impact on questions of how heuristic score functions should be represented and what structure they might be expected to exhibit.},

 abstract = {The automatic configuration of algorithms is a dynamic field of research. Its potential for producing highly performing algorithms may change the way we design algorithms. So far, automatic algorithm configuration tools have almost exclusively been applied to configure single-objective algorithms. In this paper, we investigate the usage of automatic algorithm configuration tools to improve multi-objective algorithms. In fact, this is the first article we are aware of where state-of-the-art multi-objective optimisers are configured in an automatic way. This automatic configuration is done for five variants of multi-objective flow-shop problems. Our experimental results show that we can reach at least the same and often a better final quality than a recently proposed state-of-the-art algorithm for these problems.},

We use in this paper some results of landscapes theory and Krawtchouk polynomials to exactly compute the expected value of the fitness of a mutated solution. We prove that this expectation is a polynomial in p, the probability of flipping a single bit. We analyse these polynomials and propose some applications of the obtained theoretical results.},

Our formalisation of bias relates to the symmetry group of the problem class under consideration, establishing a connection with previous work on No Free Lunch. Our definition is motivated and justified by a series of results, including the outcome that given a biased algorithm, there exists a corresponding unbiased algorithm with the same expected behaviour (over the problem class) and equal or better worst-case performance. For the case of evolutionary algorithms, it is already known how to construct unbiased mutation and crossover operators, and we summarise those results.},

 abstract = {Unbiased black-box complexity was recently introduced as a refined complexity model for randomised search heuristics (Lehre and Witt, GECCO 2010). For several problems, this notion avoids the unrealistically low complexity results given by the classical model of Droste, Jansen, and Wegener (Theor. Comput. Sci. 2006). In this work, we show that for two natural problems the unbiased black-box complexity remains artificially small. For the classical JumpK test function class and for a subclass of the well-known Partition problem, we give mutation-only unbiased black-box algorithms having complexity O(n log n). Since the first problem usually needs Theta(nk) function evaluations to be optimised by standard heuristics and the second is even NP-complete, these black-box complexities seem not to indicate the true difficulty of the two problems for randomised search heuristics.},

 abstract = {Recombination (or called crossover) operators are a kind of characterising feature of evolutionary algorithms (EAs). The usefulness of recombination operators has been verified empirically in many practical applications, and has also been theoretically studied in single-objective optimisation. For multi-objective optimisation, however, there lacks strong evidence on whether the recombination operators can lead to a better running time. In this paper, we establish some theoretical support to the use of recombination in multi-objective optimisation. We analyse the running time of REMO, a simple multi-objective EA with a recombination operator, on two well-studied bi-objective problems, i.e., the LOTZ and the COCZ problems. Our analysis results disclose that the average running time of REMO on LOTZ and COCZ is Theta(n2) and Theta(n log n), respectively, improved from Theta(n3) and Theta(n2) as when the recombination operator is turned off, respectively. These results imply that the recombination operator is crucial for the efficiency of REMO on these two problems. The analysis also suggests that, generally, recombination operators can be helpful to multi-objective optimisation as they may accelerate the filling of the Pareto front through recombining diverse solutions.},

We provide formal results showing that, in an abstract infinite-population model, proportional selection optimises expected fitness, truncation selection optimises order statistics, and tournament selection can oscillate. The winner in a population depends on the choice of selection rule, especially when fitness distributions differ between individuals resulting in variable risk. These findings are further developed through empirical results on a novel stochastic optimisation problem called Die4, which, while simple, extends existing benchmark problems by admitting a variety of interpretations of optimality.},

OEFF is by itself conditionally optimal over all problem classes, albeit impractical. Here, we complement this algorithm with an optimal sample selection strategy that removes the condition. Consequently, the performance of this combined algorithm over a domain is the black-box complexity of that domain, providing a new technique for deriving black-box complexity. Additionally, we suggest techniques to perform runtime analysis of our extended OEFF algorithm. We discuss how those techniques can be used to build an algorithm that is targeted, practical, yet equivalent to OEFF with optimal sampling over the target domain. This is demonstrated on the Generalised Leading Ones problem domain, where we derive black-box complexity and develop an optimal algorithm.},

First, the upper bound on the expected running time of the most successful quasirandom evolutionary algorithm for the OneMax function is improved from 1.28n ln n to 0.982n ln n, which breaks the barrier of n ln n posed by coupon-collector processes. Compared to the classical 1+1-EA, whose runtime will for the first time be analysed with respect to terms of lower order, this represents a speedup by more than a factor of e=2.71...},

We analyse GP in the well-known PAC learning framework and point out how it can observe quality changes in the the evolution of functions by random sampling. This leads to computational complexity bounds for a linear GP algorithm for perfectly learning any member of a simple class of linear pseudo-Boolean functions. Furthermore, we show that the same algorithm on the functions from the same class finds good approximations of the target function in less time.},
