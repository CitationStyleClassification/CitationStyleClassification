 abstract = {Current research in evolutionary robotics is largely focused on creating controllers by either evolving neural networks or refining genetic programs based on grammar trees. We propose the use of the parallel, dataflow languages for the construction of effective robotic controllers and the evolution of new controllers using genetic programming techniques. These languages have the advantages of being built on concurrent execution frameworks that lend themselves to formal verification along with being visualized as a dataflow graph. In this paper, we compare and contrast the development and subsequent evolution of one such process-oriented control algorithm. Our control software was built from composable, communicating processes executing in parallel, and we tested our solution in an annual fire-fighting robotics competition. Subsequently, we evolved new controllers in a virtual simulation of this parallel dataflow domain, and in doing so discovered and quantified more efficient solutions. This research demonstrates the effectiveness of using process networks as the basis for evolutionary robotics.},

 abstract = {This paper presents initial results of applying a Genetic Programming (GP) approach to the evolution of process algebra models defined in Bio-PEPA. An incomplete model of a system is provided together with target behaviour. GP is then used to evolve new definitions that complete the model while ensuring a good fit to target data. Our results show that a set of effective models can be developed with this approach that can either be used directly or further refined using a modeller's domain knowledge. Such an approach can greatly reduce the time taken to develop new models, enabling a modeller to focus on the subtler modelling aspects of the problem domain. Although the work presented here concerns the modelling of biological systems, the approach is generally applicable to systems for which appropriate target behaviour can be captured and that can be formalised as a set of communicating processes.},

 abstract = {In this paper we propose a new algorithm called HyperGPEFS (HyperGP with Explicit Fitness Sharing). It is based on a HyperNEAT, which is a well-established evolutionary method employing indirect encoding of artificial neural networks. Indirect encoding in HyperNEAT is realized via special function called Compositional and Pattern Producing Network (CPPN), able to describe a neural network of arbitrary size. CPPNs are represented by network structures, which are evolved by means of a slightly modified version of another, well-known algorithm NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies). HyperGP is a variant of HyperNEAT, where the CPPNs are optimized by Genetic Programming (GP). Published results reported promising improvement in the speed of convergence.

Our approach further extends HyperGP by using fitness sharing to promote a diversity of a population. Here, we thoroughly compare all three algorithms on six different tasks. Fitness sharing demands a definition of a tree distance measure. Among other five, we propose a generalized distance measure which, in conjunction with HyperGPEFS, significantly outperforms HyperNEAT and HyperGP on all, but one testing problems. Although this paper focuses on indirect encoding, the proposed distance measures are generally applicable.},

Pareto competitive coevolution provides a potential framework for archiving useful training instances between generations under an archive of finite size. Such a coevolutionary framework is defined for the online evolution of classifiers under genetic programming. Benchmarking is performed under multi-class data sets with class imbalance and training partitions with between 1,000's to 100,000's of instances. The impact of enforcing different constraints for accessing the stream are investigated. The role of online adaptation is explicitly documented and tests made on the relative impact of label error on the quality of streaming classifier results.},

 abstract = {Complex networks have attracted a large amount of research attention, especially over the past decade, due to their prevalence and importance in our daily lives. Numerous human-designed models have been proposed that aim to capture and model different network structures, for the purpose of improving our understanding the real-life phenomena and its dynamics in different situations. Groundbreaking work in genetics, medicine, epidemiology, neuroscience, telecommunications, social science and drug discovery, to name some examples, have directly resulted. Because the graph models are human made (a very time consuming process) using a small subset of example graphs, they often exhibit inaccuracies when used to model similar structures. This paper represents the first exploration into the use of genetic programming for automating the discovery and algorithm design of graph models, representing a totally new approach with great interdisciplinary application potential. We present exciting initial results that show the potential of GP to replicate existing complex network algorithms.},

 abstract = {Recently Quantitative Genetics has been successfully employed to understand and improve operators in some Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) implementations. This theory offers a phenotypic view of an algorithm's behavior at a population level, and suggests new ways of quantifying and measuring concepts such as exploration and exploitation. In this paper, we extend the quantitative genetics approach for use with Genetic Programming (GP), adding it to the set of GP analysis techniques. We use it in combination with some existing diversity and bloat measurement tools to measure, analyze and predict the evolutionary behavior of several GP algorithms. GP specific benchmark problems, such as ant trail and symbolic regression, are used to provide new insight into how various evolutionary forces work in combination to affect the search process. Finally, using the tools, a multivariate phenotypic crossover operator is designed to both improve performance and control bloat on the difficult ant trail problem.},

 abstract = {Reaction systems is a formalism inspired by chemical reactions introduced by Rozenberg and Ehrenfeucht. Recently, an evolutionary algorithm based on this formalism, called Evolutionary Reaction Systems, has been presented. This new algorithm proved to have comparable performances to other well-established machine learning methods, like genetic programming, neural networks and support vector machines on both artificial and real-life problems. Even if the results are encouraging, to make Evolutionary Reaction Systems an established evolutionary algorithm, an in depth analysis of the effect of its parameters on the search process is needed, with particular focus on those parameters that are typical of Evolutionary Reaction Systems and do not have a counterpart in traditional evolutionary algorithms. Here we address this problem for the first time. The results we present show that one particular parameter, between the ones tested, has a great influence on the performances of Evolutionary Reaction Systems, and thus its setting deserves practitioners' particular attention: the number of symbols used to represent the reactions that compose the system. Furthermore, this work represents a first step towards the definition of a set of default parameter values for Evolutionary Reaction Systems, that should facilitate their use for beginners or inexpert practitioners.},

Here, we propose an algorithm that first decomposes data from such systems into components with dynamics at different time scales and then performs symbolic regression separately for each scale.

 abstract = {This paper explores a range of class boundary determination techniques that can be used to improve performance of Genetic Programming (GP) on binary classification tasks. These techniques involve selecting an individualised boundary threshold in order to reduce implicit bias that may be introduced through employing arbitrarily chosen values. Individuals that can chose their own boundaries and the manner in which they are applied, are freed from having to learn to force their outputs into a particular range or polarity and can instead concentrate their efforts on seeking a problem solution.

Our investigation suggests that while a particular boundary selection method may deliver better performance for a given problem, no single method performs best on all problems studied. We propose a new flexible combined technique which gives near optimal performance across each of the tasks undertaken. This method together with seven other techniques is tested on six benchmark binary classification data sets. Experimental results obtained suggest that the strategy can improve test fitness, produce smaller less complex individuals and reduce run times. Our approach is shown to deliver superior results when benchmarked against a standard GP system, and is very competitive when compared with a range of other machine learning algorithms.},

This is in contrast to a spatial co-evolutionary mechanism (SCALP) that appears to avoid bloat, without any need for express bloat control mechanisms. A previously analysed real world problem (human oral bioavailability prediction) is examined. The behaviour of SCALP on this problem is quite different from that of standard GP and operator equalisation leading to short, general candidate solutions.},

Instead of using a prototype tree, Operator-Free Genetic Programming learns the distribution of ancestor node chains, "n-grams", in a fit fraction of each generation's population. It then uses this information, via sampling, to create trees for the next generation. Ancestral n-grams are used because an analysis of a GP run conducted by learning depth first graphical models for each generation indicated their emergence as substructures of conditional dependence. We are able to show that our algorithm, without an operator and a prototype tree, achieves, on average, performance close to conventional tree based crossover GP on the problem we study. Our approach sets a direction for pattern-based EDA GP which off ers better tractability and improvements over GP with operators or EDAs using prototype trees.},

The standard Context-Free Grammars (CFGs) used in GE, Genetic Programming (GP) (which uses a special type of CFG with just a single non-terminal) and most other grammar-based system are not well-suited for codifying information about context. AGs, on the other hand, are grammars that contain functional units that can help determine context which, as this paper demonstrates, is key to removing ineffective code.

The results presented in this paper indicate that, on a selection of grammars, the prevention of the appearance of ineffective code through the use of context analysis significantly improves the performance of and resistance to code bloat over both standard GE and GP for both Santa Fe Trail (SFT) and Los Altos Hills (LAH) trail version of the ant problem with same amount of energy used.},

It allows us to characterize programming tasks in terms of traces of programs that solve them, and to propose certain measures that reveal their properties. We are primarily interested in measures that quantitatively characterize functional (semantic, behavioral) modularity of programming tasks. The experiments conducted on large samples of linear programs written in Push demonstrate that semantic structure varies from task to task, and reveal patterns of different forms of modularity. In particular, we identify interesting relationships between task modularity, task complexity, and program length, and conclude that a great share of programming tasks are modular.},

Some of its benchmark problems are popular purely through historical contingency, and they can be criticized as too easy or as providing misleading information concerning real-world performance, but they persist largely because of inertia and the lack of good alternatives. Even where the problems themselves are impeccable, comparisons between studies are made more difficult by the lack of standardization. We argue that the definition of standard benchmarks is an essential step in the maturation of the field. We make several contributions towards this goal. We motivate the development of a benchmark suite and define its goals; we survey existing practice; we enumerate many candidate benchmarks; we report progress on reference implementations; and we set out a concrete plan for gathering feedback from the GP community that would, if adopted, lead to a standard set of benchmarks.},

Following a suggestion in the GECCO-2011 publication on this technique we show here how tag-based modules can be incorporated into a more standard tree-based genetic programming system. We describe the technique in detail along with some possible extensions, outline arguments for its simplicity and potential power, and present results obtained using the technique on problems for which other modularization techniques have been shown to be useful. The results are mixed; substantial benefits are seen on the lawnmower problem but not on the Boolean even-4-parity problem. We discuss the observed results and directions for future research.},

 abstract = {Modularity has been an important vein of research in evolutionary algorithms. Past research in evolutionary computation has shown that techniques able to decompose the benchmark problems examined in this work into smaller, more easily solved, sub-problems have an advantage over those which do not. This work describes and analyzes a number of approaches to discover sub-solutions (modules) in the grammatical evolution algorithm. Data from the experiments carried out show that particular approaches to identifying modules are better suited to certain problem types, at varying levels of difficulty. The results presented here show that some of these approaches are able to significantly outperform standard grammatical evolution and grammatical evolution using automatically defined functions on a subset of the problems tested. The results also point to a number of possibilities for extending this work to further enhance approaches to modularity.},

 abstract = {A developmental, ontogenic approach to Capacitated Arc Routing Problems (CARPs) is introduced. The genotypes of this method are constructive heuristics specified as trees of mathematical functions which are evolved with Genetic Programming (GP). In a genotype-phenotype mapping, they guide a virtual vehicle which starts at the depot. The genotype is used to compute a heuristic value for each edge with unsatisfied demands. Local information such as the visiting costs from the current position, the remaining load of the vehicle, and the edge demands are available to the heuristic. The virtual vehicle then serves the edge with the lowest heuristic value and is located at its end. This process is repeated until all requirements have been satisfied. The resulting phenotypes are sets of tours which, in turn, are sequences of edges. We show that our method has three advantages: 1) The genotypes can be reused to seed the population in new GP runs. 2) The size of the genotypes is independent from the problem scale. 3) The evolved heuristics even work well in modified or dynamic scenarios and are robust in the presence of noise.},

 abstract = {Extracting features from images is an important task in order to identify (classify) the patterns contained. The Evolutionary Computation and Reinforcement Learning technique of Learning Classifier Systems (LCSs) has been successfully applied to classification tasks, but rarely to image pattern classification due to the large search space associated with pixel data. Recently, a Feature Pattern Classification System (FPCS), using Haar-like features has been introduced with promising results in the image recognition domain. This system used a confusion-matrix to direct learning to hard to classify classes, but due to its reinforcement learning nature was required to estimate the ground truth. The novel work presented here adopts a supervised learning (UCS-based) approach into the FPCS framework. This work is compared with the original XCS-based system, updated to include the known ground-truth of the confusion matrix to aid comparison, albeit no longer reinforcement learning. Results on the 10 class MNIST numerical digits recognition task show that the XCS-based FPCS produces better classification due to its complete mapping guiding learning. However, results on the 26 class NIST character recognition task show that the UCS-based scales better as it does not require the complete mapping. The human readable rules produced by each system, coupled with the competitive classification performance compared with similar techniques, supports future work on both the XCS and UCS-based FPCS.},

In general, features based on a small area are used to suppress noise and texture. However, there is very little guidance in the literature on how to select the area size. In this paper, we employ Genetic Programming (GP) to evolve edge detectors via automatically searching for features based on flexible blocks rather than dividing a fixed window into small areas based on different directions. Experimental results for natural images show that using blocks to extract features obtains better performance than using single pixels only to construct detectors, and that GP can successfully choose the block size for extracting features.},

 abstract = {We present a novel form of automated game theoretic mechanism design in which mechanisms and players co-evolve. We also model the memetic propagation of strategies through a population of players, and argue that this process represents a more accurate depiction of human behavior than conventional economic models. The resulting model is evaluated by evolving mechanisms for the ultimatum game, and replicates the results of empirical studies of human economic behaviors, as well as demonstrating the ability to evaluate competing hypothesizes for the creation of economic incentives.},

However, the computational cost increases considerably with the expansion of the scale of problems. In this paper, we introduce a GPU-accelerated hybrid variant of GEP named pGEP (parallel GEP). In order to find the optimal constant coefficients locally on the fixed function structure, the Method of Least Square (MLS) has been embedded into the GEP evolutionary process. We tested pGEP using a broad problem set with a varying number of instances. In the performance experiment, the GPU-based GEP, when compared with the traditional GEP version, increased speeds by approximately 250 times. We compared pGEP with other well-known constant creation methods in terms of accuracy, demonstrating MLS performs at several orders of magnitude higher in terms of both the best residuals and average residuals.},

 abstract = {This paper contributes to the rigorous understanding of genetic programming algorithms by providing runtime complexity analyses of the well-studied Max problem. Several experimental studies have indicated that it is hard to solve the Max problem with crossover-based algorithms. Our analyses show that different variants of the Max problem can provably be solved using simple mutation-based genetic programming algorithms.

Our results advance the body of computational complexity analyses of genetic programming, indicate the importance of mutation in genetic programming, and reveal new insights into the behavior of mutation-based genetic programming algorithms.},
