abstract={In this paper, we present results on the automatic tuning of
an adaptive traffic light controller. The traffic light controller is
inspired by some swarm intelligence techniques and uses numerical values
that are adapted by the principles of stigmergy to estimate queue
lengths. These estimates are used in a probabilistic mechanism that
switches between traffic light control strategies and determines phase
lengths. This traffic light controller adapts through this specific
mechanism to the current traffic situation but to define its behavior
more than 100 parameters are used. To determine appropriate parameter
settings, we therefore explored the automatic configuration of this
traffic light controller. The main focus in this article is to examine
whether the controller parameters require adaptation to major
time-varying changes to reach best possible performance. We propose a
strategy to deal with such changes and experimentally evaluate the
impact limited re-tunings have on the controller performance.},

acceptance criterion. In the initialization phase, a modified NEH
(Nawaz-Enscore-Ham) is proposed to generate a promising initial
solution. In the local search phase, four local searching methods based
on problem properties (i.e. insert move within factory, insert move
between factories, swap move between factories) are proposed to enhance
searching ability. The effectiveness of the initialization phase and
local search method is shown by numerical comparison, and the
comparisons with the recently published iterated greedy algorithms
demonstrate the high effectiveness and searching ability of the proposed
HIG for solving the DNWFSP.},

abstract={The performance of a method for reducing the fuel consumption

simulation and using a real HDV. The method, which involves speed
profile optimization using a genetic algorithm, was applied to a set of
road profiles (covering sections of 10 km), resulting in average fuel
savings of 11.5% and 10.2% (relative to standard cruise control), in the
simulation and the real HDV, respectively. Here, a compact
representation of road profiles in the form of composite Bézier curves
has been used, thus reducing the search space for speed profile
optimization, compared to an earlier approach. In addition to
outperforming MPC-based methods commonly found in the literature by at
least 3 percentage points (in similar settings), the results also show
that our simulations are sufficiently accurate to be transferred
directly to a real HDV. In cases where the allowed range of speed
variation was restricted, the proposed method outperformed standard
predictive cruise control (PCC) by an average of around 3 percentage
points as well, over the same road profiles.},

abstract={Computing evolutionary distances using gene order data is a
complex combinatory problem; nevertheless, for specific metrics exact
polynomial algorithms were proposed, having in many cases non trivial
approaches. This scenario can become harder if we want to reconstruct
phylogenies based on gene order data: first it is necessary to explore
the search space of possible tree structures which is well-known to be
exponential; second, it is necessary a method for evaluating the cost of
these trees, i.e. to find a labeling of the internal nodes that leads to
the most parsimonious cost of a tree under a given evolutionary
distance. The latter problem was shown to be NP-hard even for 3 genomes
(median problem) under many evolutionary distances. In this paper we
propose a variable neighborhood search approach for solving the large
phylogeny problem for data based on gene orders. Also, a greedy approach
is proposed for the small phylogeny problem aiming to reduce the running
time of the Kovac et al. dynamic programming approach. Our proposed
algorithms were implemented as the software called HELPHY. Experiments
showed that the running time is improved for finding trees with good
scores (reversal distance) for the Campanulaceae dataset, and a new tree
structure was found having the best known score (double cut and join
distance) for the case of Hemiascomycetes dataset.},

evaluated against competitive feature-based Inverse Reinforcement
Learning approaches. At the cost of execution time, neural networks
allow for non-linear combinations of features in state evaluations. This
results in better correspondence to observed examples as opposed to
using linear combinations. This work also extends existing work on
Bayesian Non-Parametric Feature construction for Inverse Reinforcement
Learning by using non-linear combinations of intermediate data to
improve performance. The algorithm is observed to be specifically
suitable for a linearly solvable non-deterministic Markov Decision
Processes in which multiple rewards are sparsely scattered in state
space. This translates to real-world control problems such as those in
robotics and automation (e.g. the robust output tracking problem or
controlling an n-joint arm), where the underlying equations can be made
linear. A conclusive performance hierarchy between evaluated algorithms
is presented.},

abstract={Multilevel inverters are mainly used for DC to AC power
conversion and these inverters can be classified into types current
source inverter (CSI) and voltage source inverter (VSI). Voltage source
inverters are more common in power industry to convert lower levels of
DC voltages into higher levels of AC voltages. In the process of
conversion widely implemented pulse width modulated (PWM) switching
technique of DC sources introduces harmonics in inverter output voltage.
Total harmonic distortion (THD) is a measure of harmonic pollution in
the power system and it is observed that variations in both DC voltages
and switching angles of inverter affect the THD of inverter output
voltage. Cascaded multilevel symmetric inverters ideally have DC sources
all equal and constant. This paper considers inverters where DC sources
can be unequal, a justifiable and realistic supposition. Optimal values
of DC voltages and switching angles, which minimize THD level, are found
using evolutionary algorithm. An advanced form of Differential Evolution
(DE), called LSHADE-EpSin, is applied for the optimization problem.
SHADE is a success history based parameter adaptation technique of DE.
LSHADE improves the performance of SHADE with linearly reducing the
population size in successive generations. LSHADE-EpSin introduces an
additional adaptation technique for control parameters of the
evolutionary algorithm. The algorithm has successfully been implemented
for higher levels of inverters considered in the scope of our research
study.},

abstract={Setting of turbines in a windfarm is a complex task as several
factors need to be taken into consideration. During recent years,
researchers have applied various evolutionary algorithms to windfarm
layout problem by converting it to a single objective and at the most
two objective optimization problem. The prime factor governing placement
of turbines is the wake effect attributed to the loss of kinetic energy
by wind after it passes over a turbine. Downstream turbine inside the
wake region generates less output power. Optimizing the wake loss helps
extract more power out of the wind. The cost of turbine is tactically
entwined with generated output to form single objective of cost per unit
of output power e.g. cost/kW. This paper proposes an application of
L-SHADE algorithm, an advanced form of Differential Evolution (DE)
algorithm, to minimize the objective cost/kW. SHADE is a success history
based parameter adaptation technique of DE. L-SHADE improves the
performance of SHADE with linearly reducing the population size in

optimization of continuous variables. The present study suggests an
approach of using algorithm L-SHADE in discrete location optimization

assignment problem as a search problem and defined a fitness function

empirical evaluation to assess the fitness function together with six
search algorithms using a real-world case study and 120 artificial
problems to assess the scalability of the proposed fitness function.

solve many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs). In such approaches,
the MaOP is decomposed into several single-objective sub-problems and
solved simultaneously guided by a set of predefined, uniformly
distributed reference vectors. The reference vectors are constructed by
joining a set of uniformly sampled points to the ideal point. Use of
such reference vectors originating from the ideal point has so far
performed reasonably well on common benchmarks such as DTLZs and WFGs,
since the geometry of their Pareto fronts can be easily mapped using
these reference vectors. However, the approach may not deliver a set of
well distributed solutions for problems with Pareto fronts which are
convex/concave or where the shape of the Pareto front is not best suited
for such set of reference vectors (e.g. minus series of DTLZ and WFG
test problems). While the notion of reference vectors originating from
the nadir point has been suggested in the literature in the past, they
have rarely been used in decomposition based algorithms. Such reference
vectors are complementary in nature with the ones originating from the
ideal point. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a decomposition
based approach which attempts to use both these two sets of reference
vectors and chooses the most appropriate set at each generation based on
the s-energy metric. The performance of the approach is presented and
objectively compared with a number of recent algorithms. The results
clearly highlight the benefits of such an approach especially when the
nature of the Pareto front is not known a priori.},

initial population of geometric semantic genetic programming is created
using the best individuals of a set of separate subpopulations, or
demes, some of which run standard genetic programming and the others
geometric semantic genetic programming for few generations. Geometric
semantic genetic programming with this novel initialization technique is
shown to outperform geometric semantic genetic programming using the
traditional ramped half-and-half algorithm on six complex symbolic
regression applications. More specifically, on the studied problems, the
proposed initialization technique allows us to generate solutions with
comparable or even better generalization ability, and of significantly
smaller size than the ramped half-and-half algorithm.},

two subpopulations, one of which runs geometric semantic genetic

independently and in parallel, exchanging individuals at prefixed
synchronization instants. The presented experimental results, obtained
on five real-life symbolic regression applications, suggest that MPHGP
is able to find solutions that are comparable, or even better, than the
ones found by geometric semantic genetic programming, both on training
and on unseen testing data. At the same time, MPHGP is also able to find
solutions that are significantly smaller than the ones found by

abstract={Linear Genetic Programming (LGP) is an evolutionary algorithm
aimed at solving computational problems, most common problem types being
symbolic regression and classification. The standard method for
selecting the parent individuals that get to undergo modification at
each generation of the algorithm is tournament selection, which operates
based on an aggregate fitness value computed on the whole training
dataset. Lexicase selection, a novel parent selection method introduced
by Lee Spector and his research group, works differently by randomly
ordering the samples in the training dataset and using each of them in
turn to eliminate parent candidates from consideration. As a result it
allows for selecting specialist individuals, which perform well on some
samples but badly on others, instead of generalist individuals whose
average performance on all of the samples is good. Lexicase selection
has previously been tested on tree-GP and PushGP, but not on LGP. In
this study, we use three different benchmark problems to compare its
performance to tournament selection, investigating the mean best fitness
values of the test runs at each generation, as well as the effect of the
parent selection operator on behavioural diversity. We conclude that

abstract={Geometric semantic genetic programming is a hot topic in
evolutionary computation and recently it has been used with success on
several problems from Biology and Medicine. Given the young age of
geometric semantic genetic programming, in the last few years
theoretical research, aimed at improving the method, and applicative
research proceeded rapidly and in parallel. As a result, the current
state of the art is confused and presents some “holes”. For instance,
some recent improvements of geometric semantic genetic programming have
never been applied to some popular biomedical applications. The
objective of this paper is to fill this gap. We consider the biomedical
applications that have more frequently been used by genetic programming
researchers in the last few years and we systematically test, in a
consistent way, using the same parameter settings and configurations,
all the most popular existing variants of geometric semantic genetic
programming on all those applications. Analysing all these results, we
obtain a much more homogeneous and clearer picture of the state of the
art, that allows us to draw stronger conclusions.},

function in the LA updates the probability vector for selecting the
actions, corresponding to six removal and six insertion methods. We also
propose a new insertion method based on Hungarian algorithm, which is
applied to solve subproblems optimally. Computational experiments are
performed to verify the performance of the proposed method. A set of
instances available in the literature with problems up to 150 jobs and
10 machines is employed in the experiments. The proposed LA-ALNS is
compared against three other algorithms from the literature. The results
suggest that our algorithm has better performance in most of cases (88%)
under the defined conditions of experiments. Statistical tests also
suggest that LA-ALNS is better than the other algorithms from the
literature. The proposed method is able to automatically choose the most
suitable heuristics for the instance of the problem, through adaptation

from high computational cost due to the approximation requirement of the

adjust the computational expenditure according to each frame in the
video. Furthermore, a new appearance model based on Earth mover's

Additionally, by visualizing the populations obtained during the

this way, the algorithm can benefit from the accumulated effect of
applying multiple heuristics. A key factor in this algorithm is the
strategy for choosing the sampling length. We discuss a balanced
strategy in a setting that contains two agnostic assumptions: First, we
do not have detailed knowledge about the problem domain being solved
except that we have access to the objective function and a set of
predefined heuristics. Secondly, we have no information about the amount
of time allocated for running our algorithm. We present a theoretical
guarantee on using this strategy to choose the sampling lengths and
derive some variants based on this strategy. Empirical results also
confirm that these strategies deliver desired behavior. Finally, we
briefly discuss the extension of incorporating a learning mechanism into
the algorithm.},

abstract={This paper investigates the evolution of two types of simple
Genotype Phenotype Mappings (GPMs): a many-to-one mapping and a
one-to-many mapping. Both GPMs are under genetic control. For both types
of mappings different Regions Of Maximum Adaptability (ROMAs) are found.
These ROMAs are the regions - in a paramterized space of GPMs -
evolution leads to. The attraction towards these ROMAs increases as
selection pressure increases. Finally, this paper discusses the
evolution of pleiotropy and the ROMAs it leads to.},

abstract={Feature selection is an important task in machine learning,
which aims to reduce the dataset dimensionality while at least
maintaining the classification performance. Particle Swarm Optimisation
(PSO) has been widely applied to feature selection because of its
effectiveness and efficiency. However, since feature selection is a
challenging task with a complex search space, PSO easily gets stuck at
local optima. This paper aims to improve the PSO's searching ability by
applying genetic operators such as crossover and mutation to assist the
swarm to explore the search space better. The proposed genetic operators
are specifically designed for feature selection, which not only improve
the quality of current feature subsets but also make the search
smoother. The proposed algorithm, called CMPSO, is tested and compared
with three recent PSO based feature selection algorithms. Experimental
results on eight datasets show that CMPSO can adapt with different
numbers of features to evolve small feature subsets, which achieve
similar or better classification performance than using all features and
the three PSO based algorithms. The analysis on evolutionary processes
shows that genetic operators assist CMPSO to evolve better solutions
than the original PSO.},

make them closer to superior ones, it can be implemented in a simple

HyCon is a combination of an Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization

version of our previously developed constraint handling method for
single objective optimization. A constrained bi-objective problem is
converted into a tri-objective problem where the additional objective is
formed using summation of constrained violation. The performance of
HyCon is tested on four constrained bi-objective problems. The
non-dominated solutions are compared with a standard evolutionary
multi-objective optimization algorithm (NSGA-II) with respect to
hypervolume and attainment surface. The simulation results illustrates
the effectiveness of the HyCon method. The HyCon either outperformed or
produced similar performance as compared to NSGA-II.},

optimize the weight coefficients of the power spectrum of the
Fourier-transformed signal of lateral acceleration of a moving car. The
evolved weighted power spectrum detects the steering oscillations caused
by the delayed steering response of a human driver in normal, routine
driving situations - traffic-less driving on straight and curved roads.
Delayed steering response is often a result of drivers having an
inadequate cognitive load due to either distraction or cognitive
overload. The experimental results, conducted on a realistically
simulated car and its environment, indicate that, compared to the power
spectrum featuring equal (flat) weight coefficients, the evolved
weighted power spectrum facilitates improved discrimination between (i)
signals of the lateral acceleration of the car driven by cognitively
impaired (i.e., distracted by texting on a mobile phone while driving)
drivers and (ii) analog signals of the car, driven by fully attentive
drivers. Moreover, for all human drivers who participated in the
experiments, the weighted power spectrum of the lateral acceleration of
the car driven with distraction, even on a straight section of the road
(i.e., inherently featuring lower values of the power spectrum) is even
higher than that of the car driven by attentive drivers along curved
roads (inherently, featuring higher values of the power spectrum). These
results suggest that the proposed method would be applicable for
discriminating between subtle driver-induced steering oscillations on
straight roads and well-manifested, yet normal steering behavior of
drivers when cornering. We view the obtained results as a step towards
the development of an early warning system of the inadequate cognitive
load of drivers under routine driving conditions - well before any
urgent reaction to an eventually dangerous traffic situation might be
needed.},

the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP). Pollard's Rho
algorithm is a well known method for solving the ECDLP and thereby
breaking ciphers based on elliptic curves. It has the same time
complexity as other known methods but is advantageous due to smaller
memory requirements. This paper considers how to speed up the Rho
process by modifying a key component: the iterating function, which is
the part of the algorithm responsible for determining what point is
considered next when looking for a collision. It is replaced with an
alternative that is found through an evolutionary process. This
alternative consistently and significantly decreases the number of

selected which leads to the favorable quality upon the population

However, MaOEAs which are widely used in solving many-objective
optimization problems (MaOPs) are considerably preferred due to their
population-based nature. In this paper, a global view-based selection
mechanism has been proposed to concern the quality of the selected
solutions from a global prospective, which is capable of simultaneously
facilitating the performance of the entire selected solutions. Indeed,
the proposed selection mechanism is equivalent to solve a linear
assignment problem whose cost matrix is constructed by the entries
concurrently measuring the convergence and diversity of each solution.
In addition, this design principle is also utilized for the mating
selection to guarantee the convergence and diversity of the selected
parents to generate promising offspring. As a case study, the proposed
global view-based selection mechanism is integrated into NSGA-III (i.e.,
GS-NSGA-III). To validate the proposed selection mechanism, extensive
experiments are performed by GS-NSGA-III against four state-of-the-art
MaOEAs over 8-, 10-, and 15-objective DTLZ1-DTLZ7 test problems. The

The multi-stage weapon target assignment (MWTA) problem is the basis of

formulated as a multi-objective constrained combinatorial optimization
problem with two competing objectives. Apart from maximizing the damage
to hostile targets, this paper follows the principle of minimizing the
ammunition consumption. Decomposition and Pareto dominance both are
efficient and prevailing strategies for solving multi-objective
optimization problems. Three competitive multi-objective optimizers:
DMOEA-εC, NSGA-II, and MOEA/D-AWA are adopted to solve multi-objective
MWTA problems efficiently. Then comparison studies among DMOEA-εC,
NSGA-II, and MOEA/D-AWA on solving three different-scale MWTA instances
are done. Three common used performance metrics are used to evaluate the
performance of each algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that
NSGA-II performs best on small-scale and medium-scale instances compared
with DMOEA-εC and MOEA/D-AWA, while DMOEA-εC shows advantages over the
other two algorithms on solving the large-scale instance.},

local optimum due to the limits of their optimization processes. To
tackle the problem, a novel differential evolution algorithm with an

Different from the selection rules of classical differential evolution
algorithm, this method firstly pre-classifies all original individuals
and trial individuals according to the scope of the individual fitness
at each generation, which will preliminarily determine whether they are
selected for the next generation. Secondly, in order to increase the
diversity of the population, we choose a few individuals from the
non-selected population with a low probability into selected ones.
Finally, the samples including partial individuals from the selected and
non-selected lists are used to train the neural networks that will learn
the selection strategy. This method will learn different selection
strategies in every generation, which will significantly accelerate the
convergence speed. The proposed change detection method, combining fuzzy
clustering with newly designed differential evolution algorithm, show
excellent performance. Experiments conducted on Synthetic Aperture Radar

necessary to make the parameters fuzzy. In this paper, we introduce the
fuzzy set theory to neural networks where the parameters are expressed

main contribution of this paper is to combine fuzzy set theory with
multi-objective sparsity to apply to neural networks, for the first

distinctive learning algorithm for feed-forward neural networks. Because
of its similarity and low computational complexity comparing with the

employing evolutionary multi-task paradigm is used to evolve the modular

is much faster than the convenient gradient-based method, it needs more
hidden neurons due to the random determination of input weights. In
proposed method, we combine the evolutionary extreme learning machine
and multi-task modular training. Each task is defined by an evolutionary
extreme learning machine with different number of hidden neurons. This

abstract={This work focuses on wide-scale freight transportation
logistics motivated by the sharp increase of on-line shopping stores and
the upsurge of Internet as the most frequently utilized selling channel
during the last decade. This huge ecosystem of one-click-away catalogs
has ultimately unleashed the need for efficient algorithms aimed at
properly scheduling the underlying transportation resources in an
efficient fashion, especially over the so-called last mile of the
distribution chain. In this context the selective pickup and delivery
problem focuses on determining the optimal subset of packets that should
be picked from its origin city and delivered to their corresponding
destination within a given time frame, often driven by the maximization
of the total profit of the courier service company. This manuscript
tackles a realistic variant of this problem where the transportation
fleet is composed by more than one vehicle, which further complicates
the selection of packets due to the subsequent need for coordinating the
delivery service from the command center. In particular the addressed
problem includes a second optimization metric aimed at reflecting a fair
share of the net benefit among the company staff based on their driven
distance. To efficiently solve this optimization problem, several
nature-inspired metaheuristic solvers are analyzed and statistically
compared to each other under different parameters of the problem setup.

algorithm is in a poor status is determined by the length of Hamiltonian
cycle, which can be obtained by transferring all the individuals into an

computed according to a modified cycle algorithm. The proposed IBSO

be manipulated by multiplication with a real-valued weight vector. By
performing such a reweighting and then taking the inverse transform, we
obtain a `filtered' version of the original heuristic. Taking the

abstract={Meta-heuristics have emerged as an efficient way to solve
NP-hard problems even without the guaranteed of optimal values. The main
issue of meta-heuristics is that they are built using domain-specific
knowledge. Therefore, they require a great effort to be adapted to a new
domain. The concept of Hyper-heuristic was proposed to solve this
problem. Hyper-heuristics are search methods that aim to solve
optimization problems by selecting or generating heuristics. Selection
hyper-heuristics choose from a pool of heuristics a good one to be
applied at the current stage of the optimization process. Although there
are several works focused on selection hyper-heuristics, there is no
consensus about which is the best way to define a selection strategy. In
this work, a deterministic selection strategy based on the concepts of
the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem is proposed for combinatorial
optimization. Multi-armed bandit approaches define a selection function
with two components; the first is based on the performance of an
operator and the second based on the number of times that the operator
was used. In this work, three MAB algorithms were implemented using the
HyFlex framework. An empirical parameter configuration was performed to
each algorithm, and the best setup was compared to the top ten CHeSC
2011 algorithms using the same methodology adopted during the
competition. The results obtained were comparable to those attained by
the literature. Moreover, it was concluded that the behavior of MAB
selection is heavily affected by its parameters. As this is not a
desirable behavior for hyper-heuristics, future research will
investigate ways to better deal with the parameter setting.},

efficiency. In this contribution, we consider the use of a recently

underlying a coral reef, where different corals grow, reproduce and
fight with other corals for space in the colony. CRO has recently
obtained promising results in different real-world applications and we
think its operation mode can properly cope with the 3D intensity-based
medical IR problem. We adapt the algorithm to the real-coding problem
nature and run an experimental setup tackling sixteen real-world problem
instances. The new proposal is benchmarked with recent, state-of-the-art

performance. The main goal of the present study is to control
oscillation of a rectangular plate using minimum number of piezoelectric
sensors and actuators (i.e., objective one) and finding their optimum

the mentioned two objectives are in conflict. The plate have been

the piezoelectric sensor-actuators effects, the control equation of the
cantilever plate has been obtained. In order to find the optimum number
and placement of the sensors and actuators, the multi-objective genetic
algorithm (GA) has been used and the objective functions have been
defined based on maximization of observability and countability indexes
of the cantilever plate. After conducting the optimization process, a
few thumb rules have been extracted using the innovization technique.

abstract={Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is a nonparametric methodology
for estimating technical efficiency of a set of Decision Making Units
(DMUs) from a dataset of inputs and outputs. This paper is devoted to
computational aspects of DEA models under the application of the
Principle of Least Action. This principle guarantees that the efficient
closest targets are determined as benchmarks for each assessed unit.
Usually, these models have been addressed in the literature by applying
unsatisfactory techniques, based fundamentally on combinatorial NP-hard
problems. Recently, some heuristics have been developed to partially
solve these DEA models. This paper improves the heuristic methods used
in previous works by applying a combination of metaheuristics and an
exact method. Also, a parameterized scheme of metaheuristics is
developed in order to implement metaheuristics and
hybridations/combinations, adapting them to the particular problem
proposed here. In this scheme, some parameters are used to study several
types of metaheuristics, like Greedy Random Adaptative Search Procedure,
Genetic Algorithms or Scatter Search. The exact method is included
inside the metaheuristic to solve the particular model presented in this
paper. A hyperheuristic is used on top of the parameterized scheme in
order to search, in the space of metaheuristics, for metaheuristics that
provide solutions close to the optimum. The method is competitive with
exact methods, obtaining fitness close to the optimum with low
computational time.},

abstract={Mutation testing is a method used to assess and improve the
fault detection capability of a test suite by creating faulty versions,
called mutants, of the system under test. Evolutionary Mutation Testing
(EMT), like selective mutation or mutant sampling, was proposed to
reduce the computational cost, which is a major concern when applying
mutation testing. This technique implements an evolutionary algorithm to
produce a reduced subset of mutants but with a high proportion of
mutants that can help the tester derive new test cases (strong mutants).
In this paper, we go a step further in estimating the ability of this
technique to induce the generation of test cases. Instead of measuring
the percentage of strong mutants within the subset of generated mutants,
we compute how much the test suite is actually improved thanks to those
mutants. In our experiments, we have compared the extent to which EMT
and the random selection of mutants help to find missing test cases in
C++ object-oriented systems. We can conclude from our results that the
percentage of mutants generated with EMT is lower than with the random
strategy to obtain a test suite of the same size and that the technique
scales better for complex programs.},

the main rationale to apply UK over the ordinary Kriging (OK) as the
approximator. The UK with orthogonal polynomials and basis selection

and demonstration on three synthetic functions using expected
hypervolume improvement (EHVI) and Euclidean-based expected improvement
(EEI) criterions show the increased quality of the optimized
non-dominated solutions when UK is coupled with EHVI criterion. On the
other hand, the coupling of UK with EEI does not lead to any improvement
and might produce an adverse effect. We also observed that the use of UK
mainly improves the proximity to the true Pareto front, with smaller but
notable effect on the diversity of the solutions when EHVI is applied as
the criterion. As expected, optimization using the UK shows the greatest
improvement if all objective functions can be sufficiently approximated
by the UK. Based on the results, we suggest that coupling of UK and EHVI

to emulate human DMs with different personalities and dynamically

IMO methods to adapt to different human DMs and capture DMs'
preferences. The usage of these four types of virtual DMs are
demonstrated by comparing two IMO algorithms.},

Dimension reduction-based memetic optimization strategy was proposed to
decompose a multi-objective optimization problem into several easier

optimizing the original problem by separately searching the decision

order of past data used in the regression model (number of orders of the
solution space) is decided, and weighted coefficients for observed data
at each point in time (design variables) are determined. Such a two-step
optimization problem cannot calculate the evaluation function after the
model is developed despite the fact that design variables cannot be
determined during the second step until the orders of solution space are
determined in the first step. Thus, it is a problem where simultaneous
optimization of both the first and second steps is difficult, and a
regression model with the smallest evaluation function is chosen as the
optimal model after comparison with all the solutions. However, the
self-regressing hidden Markov model used in this study for regression
requires a large amount of calculation during design variable
determination due to the use of the hidden Markov. Furthermore, the
calculation and comparison of all the solutions is inefficient. For such
an optimization problem, this study proposes an actual-value genetic
algorithm (GA) with a framework capable of simultaneous optimization of
the first and second steps. The proposed method takes an approach where
in individuals that represent the solution space of different orders in

approach for clustering non-stationary data streams. The number of
clusters does not need to be known a priori and density methods are
robust to noise and changes in the statistical properties of the data.
However, most density approaches require sensitive, data dependent
parameters. These parameters greatly affect the clustering performance
and in a dynamic stream a good set of parameters at time t are not
necessarily the best at time t+1. Furthermore, these parameters are
global and so restrict the algorithm to finding clusters of the same
density. In this paper, we propose a density based algorithm with
adaptive parameters which are local to each discovered cluster. The
algorithm, denoted Ant Colony Multi-Density Clustering (ACMDC), uses
artificial ants to form nests in dense areas of the data. As the ants
move between nests, their collective memory is stored in the form of
pheromone trails. Clusters are identified as groups of similar nests.
The proposed algorithm is evaluated across a number of synthetic data
streams containing overlapping and embedded multi-density clusters. The
performance of the algorithm is shown to be favourable to a leading
density based stream-clustering algorithm despite requiring no tunable
parameters.},

abstract={The test case generation of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) face
critical challenges that traditional methods such as Model-Based Testing
cannot deal with. As a result, simulation-based testing is one of the
most commonly used techniques for testing CPSs despite sometimes being
computationally too expensive. This paper proposes a search-based
approach which is implemented on top of Non-dominated Sorting Genetic
Algorithm II (NSGA-II), the most commonly applied multi-objective search
algorithm for cost-effectively generating executable test cases in order
to test CPSs. With the aim of guiding the generation of the optimal set
of so-called reactive test cases, the approach formally defines three
cost-effectiveness measures: requirements coverage, test case similarity
and test execution time. Furthermore, we design one crossover operator
and three mutation operators (i.e., mutation at test suite level named
Mu TS, mutation at test case level named Mu TC and mutation at both
levels named Mu BO) for test case generation. We evaluate our approach
by comparing with Random Search (RS) using four case studies (one of
them is an industrial system). Moreover, we evaluate the three mutation
operators using the four case studies. The results of the experiment
(with a rigorous statistical analysis) indicated that our approach in
conjunction with the crossover operator operation and three mutation
operators significantly outperformed RS. In general, Mu BO achieved the
best performance among the three mutation operators and managed to
improve on average the test execution time by 14%, the requirements
coverage by 34%, and the test similarity by 75% as compared with RS.},

multimodal optimization that uses self-adaptive parameter control,
clustering and crowding methods. The algorithm includes a new clustering
mechanism that is based on small subpopulations with the best strategy
and, as such, improves the algorithm's efficiency. Each subpopulation is
generated according to the best individual from a population that is not
added to any other subpopulation. These small subpopulations are also
used to determine population size and to replace `bad' individuals.
Because of the small subpopulation size and crowding mechanism, bad
individuals prevent the best individuals from converging to the optimum.
Therefore, the algorithm is trying to replace bad individuals with the
individuals that are close to the best individuals. The population size
expansion is used within the algorithm according to the number of
generated subpopulations and located optima. The proposed algorithm was
tested on benchmark functions for CEC'2013 special session and
competition on niching methods for multimodal function optimization. The
performance of the proposed algorithm was comparable with the

used as wrappers for optimizing the parameters of a road traffic

FWA and FWA-ID in this practical setup has revealed that the relatively
high computational complexity of this solver with respect to other
heuristics makes it critical to speed up their convergence (specially in
cases with a costly fitness evaluation as the one tackled in this work),

implemented. The framework includes a set of parameters and components
of different MOPSOs, and two design algorithms: Grammatical Evolution

from the current solution and inserts it into the partial solution
randomly with a predetermined move size. A local search is applied to
the solution found after several block moves. If the new solution
generated after the local search is better than the current solution, it
replaces the current solution. It retains the same block size as long as
it improves. Otherwise, the block size is incremented by one and a
simulated annealing-type of acceptance criterion is used to accept the
new solution. This process is repeated until the block size reaches at
the maximum block size. In addition, we present a randomized profile
fitting heuristic with excellent results. Extensive computational
results on the Taillard's well-known benchmark suite show that the

exchange individuals between neighboring islands and, the second uses a
complete graph scheme for the distribution of individuals among islands.
Both approaches were proposed with the objective of improving precision

runtime regarding the sequential GA. Experiments were performed with
randomly generated synthetic genomes and the results show that the
parallel approach using the ring communication topology outperforms the
previously proposed GA and its parallel version in terms of accuracy,

subdividing the search space and further implementing the mutation
operator. SLGA has been used to optimize the De Jong functions, as well

Evolution (GE) is currently receiving a great deal of attention. GE is
particularly suitable for developing decision-tree classifiers because
of a framework, in which candidate solutions are generated via
production rules. Various decision-tree classifier methods based on GE
have been proposed. In general, the performance of GE systems is
improved by enhancing the genetic diversity of the candidate solutions.
Therefore, most GE methods are focused on the initialization of
solutions. However, it is known that an effective search bias based on a
landscape is also essential for evolutionary computation methods.
Unfortunately, because of their solution structures, GE-based
decision-tree classifiers can not form a unique landscape in terms of an
objective function as can real-valued optimization problems. In this
paper, we present a method for estimating a landscape using rank
correlation based on two types of features extracted from GE solutions,
and we apply it to well-known benchmark problems. We show that the
proposed method can capture a landscape effectively. To the best of the

estimation method based on GE solutions. The results in this paper help
with understanding how to establish suitable a search bias for GE-based

abstract={A supply chain network consists of facilities located in
dispersed geographical locations. This network structure can be
optimized to minimize total cost or total inventory by deciding the
order quantities and distribution of links connecting the facilities.
However, bullwhip effect (i.e., amplification of order fluctuations) is
an important performance metric for supply chains because as the order
variance increases in the downstream of the supply chain (e.g.,
distributors), the demand variance in the upstream (e.g., manufacturer)
amplifies and causes inefficiencies in the supply chain. In this study,
we optimize supply chain network structure for multi-product
multi-period two-echelon supply chain networks to minimize bullwhip. Due
to nonlinear structure of the objective function, i.e., bullwhip effect,
this paper proposes a differential evolution (DE) algorithms employing

abstract={In multiobjective evolutionary algorithms, how to select the
optimal solutions from the offspring candidate set significantly affects
the optimization process. Usually, the selection process is largely
based on the real objective values or surrogate model estimating
objective values. However, these selection processes are very time
consuming sometimes, especially for some real optimization problems.
Recently, some researches began to employ supervised classification to
assist offspring selection, but these works are difficult to prepare the
exact positive and negative samples or time consuming of parameter
tuning problems. In order to solve these disadvantages, we propose a
decomposition based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm with
semi-supervised classification. This approach using random sampling and
non-dominated sorting to construct semi supervised classifier. In each
generation, a set of candidate solutions are generated for each
subproblem and only good solutions are reserved by classifier. If there
is more than one good solutions, we calculate each of good solutions by
real objective function and choose the best one as the offspring
solution. Based on the typical decomposition based multiobjective
evolutionary algorithm MOEA/D, we design algorithm framework through
integrating the novel offspring selection process based on
semi-supervised classification. Experiments show that the proposed
algorithm performs best in most test cases and improves the performance
of MOEA/D.},

results from an optimization algorithm are utilized to derive problem
heuristics and then used in a future applications to achieve a faster

the optimization run and used in subsequent iterations. In a particular
gold processing plant optimization problem, we demonstrate the use of
derived heuristics by developing a customized evolutionary optimization
procedure which is capable of handling various complexities offered by
the problem, in a way which is much better than a classical point-based

is a typical NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem and represents
an important area in multiple distributed production systems, where a
series of jobs are to be processed on machines in one of specific
factories (processing stage) and then assembled into final products by a
single machine (assembly stage). In this study, a class of complex
DAPFSP with respect to minimizing the total tardiness is investigated by
considering real-practice constraints, including no-wait, no-idle and
due dates, labeled as DAPFSP-T hereafter. And an effective scatter
search based memetic algorithm (SS-MA) is proposed to address the
difficulties of proposed DAPFSP-T model. Specifically, in the proposed
SS-MA, a few compositive heuristics are proposed by comprehensively
deploying several well-known constructive heuristics, and serve as the
initialization method. Subset generation mechanism and solution
combination methods are deliberatively designed to implement the global
coarse exploration. Meanwhile, the improvement procedure in conventional
SS is incarnated by a three-stage simulated annealing (3SSA) with three
kinds of neighborhood structures to perform the local fine exploitation.
Through the above sophisticated combination of multiple operators, it is
expected in the proposed SS-MA the balance between global and local
search abilities could be well achieved. And it is demonstrated by our
experimental studies and comparisons that the proposed SS-MA could yield
satisfactory searching performances, where solutions are significantly
improved compared with multiple heuristic methods.},

search for suitable structures and their parameters. Each approach has
its own advantages and disadvantages. In this paper, we focus on the
first approach and develop new representations that are flexible enough
to represent diverse rules and powerful enough to cope with complex shop
conditions. Particle swarm optimisation is used in the proposed
hyper-heuristic to find optimal rules based on the representations. The
results suggest that the new representations are effective for different

The work presented in this paper is aimed to investigate the benefits
that come from the utilization of a pre-processing stage in the
execution process of the EMOAs. The experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed optimization framework is capable of producing a
satisfactory number of optimized design alternatives considering the
problem complexity and high rate of infeasibility. The addition of the
pre-processing stage appears to have a positive effect on the framework
by producing more non-dominated solutions in reduced time frames.},

Algorithm (MOEA/D) that incorporates a linkage identification technique
to enhance the ability to solve difficult multi-objective optimization
problems that have complex interactions among genes. Ensuring tight
linkages is essential for genetic recombination operators to work
effectively by preserving building blocks. For problems which are
difficult to ensure tight linkages in encoding, the dependencies among
loci have to be analyzed to identify the linkages for each building
block. The proposed MOEA/D employs Linkage Identification with
non-Monotonicity Detection (LIMD) to identify the linkages among pairs
of loci by checking the non-monotonicity of fitness differences caused
by pairwise perturbations for each scalar function in the MOEA/D. The
results of numerical experiments conducted using a difficult
multi-objective test function in which each building block is loosely
encoded over the strings indicate that the proposed MOEA/D-LIMD
outperforms the original MOEA/D and MOEA/D with tree-based graphical

a specific mode of knowledge transfer in the form of implicit genetic
transfer through chromosomal crossover. Here we further explore the
generality of MFO when diverse population based search mechanisms are
employed. In particular, in this paper, we present the first attempt to
conduct MFO with the popular particle swarm optimization and
differential evolution search. Two specific multi-tasking paradigms,
namely multifactorial particle swarm optimization (MFPSO) and

The game includes a version that uses fraction multiplication, but

evolutionary strategy called the horde of dumb agents technique to
compare and evaluate different decks. Evolution, within the horde of
dumb agents strategy, is a uniquely valuable tool for understanding how
naive players might approach a new game. It is shown that the techniques

more suitable to the realistic situation. The combination with new

suitable measure between two feasible solutions and can also be
connected with the probability matrix of EDA, the global search meme in
PrMF. Meta-Lamarckian learning strategy is also equipped in PrMF to

abstract={Optimum or near-optimum solutions of the Golomb ruler (gr)
problem have applications in information theory, error correction,
current transformers, radio frequency selection, placement of antenna
arrays in astronomy, among others. In mathematics, there is a
well-defined relationship of Golomb rulers and graceful graphs. A
massively parallel computing project on gr has been on-going for more
than 10 years: the order-24 ruler was claimed as optimum in November
2004 (after a 4-year computational effort), followed by order-25, -26,
-27 rulers in 2008, 2009, 2014. The order-28 ruler is work-in-progress.
The distribution of waiting times, in years, such as {4, 4, 1, 5} may be
impossible to predict under a variable number of processors running
simultaneously. This paper proposes a model to experimentally predict
the asymptotic runtime complexity of any gr solver that returns the
best-known-value (BKV) Golomb ruler defined by the paired list (L =
length, M = order). A subset of this list includes {(6,4), (11,5),
(17,6), (25,7), (34,8), (44,9),..., (680,30)}. Given the number of
processors N and the runtime limit t_lmt , we observe at least N_u ≥ 100
processors reaching the target BKV with the first-passage-time <; t_lmt
and say that each such observation is uncensored. In other words, the
mean runtime value we measure is based strictly on at least 100
uncensored observations from the experiment. Experiments in this paper
focus on a stochastic gr-solver that implements a variation of a
self-avoiding walk. In the total number of steps, the solver asymptotic
walkLength complexity is 409.2 × 1.0762^L . When measuring the number of
CPU seconds on a loaded grid of 100 processors, the solver asymptotic

images allow us to see the level of activity in a patient's brain. We
consider fMRI of patients before and after they underwent a smoking

that one took the drug N-acetylcysteine and the ones took a placebo. Our
goal was to classify the relapse in nicotine-dependent patients as
treatment or non-treatment based on their fMRI scans. The image slices
of brain are used as the variable and as results here we deal with a big
data problem with about 240,000 inputs. To handle this problem, the data
had to be reduced and the first process in doing that was to create a
mask to apply to all images. The mask was created by averaging the
before images for all patients and selecting the top 40% of voxels from
that average. This mask was then applied to all fMRI images for all
patients. The average of the difference in the before treatment and
after fMRI images for each patient were found and these were flattened
to one dimension. Then a matrix was made by stacking these 1D arrays on
top of each other and a data reduction algorithm was applied on it.
Lastly, this matrix was fed into some machine learning and Genetic
Programming algorithms and leave-one-out cross-validation was used to
test the accuracy. Out of all the data reduction machine learning
algorithms used, the best accuracy was obtained using Principal
Component Analysis along with Genetic Programming classifier. This gave
an accuracy of 74%, which we consider significant enough to suggest that
there is a difference in the resting-state fMRI images of a smoker that
undergoes this smoking cessation treatment compared to a smoker that
receives a placebo.},

improve the design of several mechanical systems. Numerical optimization
can be invaluable for this purpose, by allowing us to scrutinize the

numerical optimization can help us overcome limiting constraints that
restrict the evolutionary capability of biological species. Thus, we
couple high-fidelity simulations of self-propelled swimmers with
evolutionary optimization algorithms, to examine peculiar swimming
patterns observed in a number of fish species. More specifically, we
investigate the intermittent form of locomotion referred to as
`burst-and-coast' swimming, which involves a few quick flicks of the
fish's tail followed by a prolonged unpowered glide. This mode of
swimming is believed to confer energetic benefits, in addition to
several other advantages. We discover a range of intermittent-swimming
patterns, the most efficient of which resembles the swimming-behaviour
observed in live fish. We also discover patterns which lead to a marked
increase in swimming-speed, albeit with a significant increase in energy
expenditure. Notably, the use of multi-objective optimization reveals
locomotion patterns that strike the perfect balance between speed and
efficiency, which can be invaluable for use in robotic applications. The
analyses presented may also be extended for optimal design and control
of airborne vehicles. As an additional goal of the paper, we highlight

performance of the proposed modified IBEA (mIBEA) is empirically
demonstrated on the well-known DTLZ set of benchmark functions. Our
results show that mIBEA achieves comparable or better hypervolume

The modification also results in an over 8-fold speed-up for larger

Cross-domain search poses a higher level issue where a single solution

metaheuristic is often dependant on its initial parameter settings,
hence detecting the best configuration, i.e. parameter tuning is
crucial, which becomes a further challenge for cross-domain search. In
this paper, we investigate the cross-domain search performance of
Simulated Annealing via tuning for solving six problems, ranging from
personnel scheduling to vehicle routing under a stochastic local search
framework. The empirical results show that Simulated Annealing is
extremely sensitive to the initial parameter settings leading to
sub-standard performance when used as a single solution method for
cross-domain search. Moreover, we demonstrate that cross-domain
parameter tuning is inferior to domain-level tuning highlighting the
requirements for adaptive parameter configurations when dealing with
cross-domain search.},

is a multi-objective optimization problem consisting in searching the
best compromise between multiple placement constraints to find an
optimal insertion point for the tool. Many works have been proposed to
automate the decision-making process. Most of them use an aggregative
approach that transforms the problem into a mono-objective problem.
However, despite its intuitiveness, this approach is known for its
incapacity to find all optimal solutions. After a previous clinical
study in which we pointed out the interest of introducing MOEAs to
neurosurgery [12], in this work, we aim at maximizing the range of
optimal solutions proposed to the surgeon. Our study compares three
different optimization approaches: an aggregative method using a
weighted sum of the multiple constraints, an evolutionary
multi-objective method, and an exhaustive dominance-based method used as
ground truth. For each approach, we extract the set of all optimal
insertion points based on dominance rules, and analyze the common and
differing solutions by comparing the surfaces they cover. The
experiments have been performed on 30 images datasets from patients who
underwent a Deep Brain Stimulation electrode implant in the brain. It
can be observed that the areas covered by the optimal insertion points
obtained by the three methods differ significantly. The obtained results
show that the traditional weighted sum approach is not sufficient to
find the totality of the optimal solutions. The Pareto-based approaches
provide extra solutions, but neither of them could find the complete
optimal solution space. Further works should investigate either hybrid
or extended methods such as adaptive weighted sum, or hybrid
visualization of the solutions in the GUI.},

allows the inference and study of its biological function. Because
protein function is determined by its shape and the physio-chemical
properties of its exposed surface, it is extremely important to predict
accurate protein models. One of the hardest problems in Structural
Bioinformatics is associated with the prediction of the
three-dimensional structure of a protein only from its amino acid
sequence (primary structure). Coils and turns are both elements of
secondary structure in proteins where the polypeptide chain reverses its
overall direction; These structures are considered the most difficult
secondary structure to be predicted. In this paper, we propose a loop
Structure Pattern Library (SPL) which was created using experimental
information extracted from Protein Data Bank aiming to constrain the
conformational search space of proteins. The Self-Adapting Differential
Evolution (SADE) meta-heuristic was implemented for the tertiary protein
structure prediction problem using the Structure Pattern Library as
knowledge. The SADE algorithm was tested with (SADE-SPL) and without the
Structure Pattern Library. Archived results show that the lowest Root
Mean Square Deviation values were obtained when the Structure Pattern
Library was employed. Average GDT TS were higher in all SADE-SPL cases.
Thereby, our results allow us to state that SPL application knowledge in
SADE meta-heuristic is capable of predicting three-dimensional protein
structures closer to experimental structures than SADE application
without SPL.},

The Multi-Objective Quadratic Assignment Problem (mQAP) is a MOP. The
mQAP is a generalization of the classical QAP which has been extensively
studied, and used in several real-life applications. The mQAP is defined
as having as input several flows between the facilities which generate
multiple cost functions that must be optimized simultaneously. In this
study, we propose PASMOQAP, a parallel asynchronous memetic algorithm to
solve the Multi-Objective Quadratic Assignment Problem. PASMOQAP is
based on an island model that structures the population by creating
subpopulations. The memetic algorithm on each island individually evolve
a reduced population of solutions, and they asynchronously cooperate by
sending selected solutions to the neighboring islands. The experimental
results show that our approach significatively outperforms all the
island-based variants of the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm
NSGA-II. We show that PASMOQAP is a suitable alternative to solve the
Multi-Objective Quadratic Assignment Problem.},

abstract={Tertiary protein structure prediction in silico is one of the
most challenging problems in Structural Bioinformatics. The challenge
arises due to the combinatorial explosion of plausible shapes, where a
long amino acid chain ends up in one out of a vast number of
three-dimensional conformations. The rules that govern the biological
process are partially known, which difficult the development of robust
prediction methods. Many computational methods and strategies were
proposed over the last decades. Nevertheless, the problem remains open.
The agent-based paradigm has been shown a useful technique for the
applications that have repetitive and time-consuming activities,
knowledge share and management, such as the integration of different
knowledge sources and modeling of complex biological systems. In this
paper, we propose a first principle method with database information for
the 3-D protein structure prediction problem. We do so by designing a
multi-agent approach that uses concepts of evolutionary algorithms to
speed up the search phase by improving local candidate solutions from
the protein conformational space. To validate our method, we tested our
computational strategy on a test bed of eight protein sequences.
Predicted structures were analyzed regarding root-mean-square deviation,
global distance total score test and secondary structure arrangement.
The obtained results were topologically compatible with their
correspondent experimental structures, thus corroborating the
effectiveness of our proposed method. As observed, the evolutionary
multi-agent approach achieved good results in terms of the evaluted
measures and was able to efficiently search the roughness of protein
energy landscape.},

show that the MOEA without any CHTs can find feasible solutions on

migration policy. This paper proposes a migration policy to the Island
Model in which the destination island for an emigrant solution is
defined according to the attractiveness of the islands in the model. In
the proposed model the attractiveness between islands also influences
the connection between them and affect the topology of the model. This

to search for the information core, where an elite population with a new
crossover mechanism named as ordered crossover is used to accelerate the

generated by logarithm ratio operator based on the bi-temporal SAR
images acquired in the same region. Then a saliency detection model is
applied in the difference image to extract the salient regions
containing the changed class pixels. The salient regions are further
divided by fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithm into three
categories: changed class (set of pixels with high gray values),
unchanged class (set of pixels with low gray values) and undetermined
class (set of pixels with middle gray value, which are difficult to
classify). Finally, the proposed accelerated GA is applied to explore
the reduced search space formed by the undetermined-class pixels
according to an objective function considering neighborhood information.
In S-aGA, an efficient mutation operator is designed by using the
neighborhood information of undetermined-class pixels as the heuristic
information to determine the mutation probability of each
undetermined-class pixel adaptively, which accelerates the convergence
of the GA significantly. The experimental results on two data sets
demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed S-aGA. On the whole, S-aGA
outperforms five other existing methods including the simple GA in terms
of detection accuracy. In addition, S-aGA could obtain satisfying
solution within limited generations, converging much faster than the
simple GA.},

abstract={The classification of dynamical data streams is among the most
complex problems encountered in classification. This is, firstly,
because the distribution of the data streams is non-stationary, and it
changes without any prior “warning”. Secondly, the manner in which it
changes is also unknown. Thirdly, and more interestingly, the model
operates with the assumption that the correct classes of
previously-classified patterns become available at a juncture after
their appearance. This paper pioneers the use of unreported novel
schemes that can classify such dynamical data streams by invoking the
recently-introduced “Anti-Bayesian” (AB) techniques. Contrary to the
Bayesian paradigm, that compare the testing sample with the
distribution's central points, AB techniques are based on the
information in the distant-from-the-mean samples. Most Bayesian
approaches can be naturally extended to dynamical systems by dynamically
tracking the mean of each class using, for example, the exponential
moving average based estimator, or a sliding window estimator. The AB
schemes introduced by Oommen et al., on the other hand, work with a
radically different approach and with the non-central quantiles of the
distributions. Surprisingly and counter-intuitively, the reported AB
methods work equally or close-to-equally well to an optimal supervised
Bayesian scheme on a host of accepted PR problems. This thus begs its
natural extension to the unexplored arena of classification for
dynamical data streams. Naturally, for such an AB classification
approach, we need to track the non-stationarity of the quantiles of the
classes. To achieve this, in this paper, we develop an AB approach for
the online classification of data streams by applying the efficient and
robust quantile estimators developed by Yazidi and Hammer [3], [13].
Apart from the methodology itself, in this paper, we compare the
Bayesian and AB approaches. Th- results demonstrate the intriguing and
counter-intuitive results that the AB approach shows competitive results
to the Bayesian approach. Furthermore, the AB approach is much more
robust against outliers, which is an inherent property of quantile
estimators [3], [13], which is a property that the Bayesian approach
cannot match, since it rather tracks the mean.},

waits for evaluations of all solutions to generate next population. To
establish the semi-asynchronous EA, this paper proposes the asynchrony
parameter to decide how many solutions are waited, and clarifies the
effectual asynchrony related to the number of slave nodes. In the
experiment, we apply the semi-asynchronous EA to NSGA-II, which is a
well-known multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, and the
semi-asynchronous NSGA-IIs with different asynchrony are compared with
synchronous one on the multi-objective optimization benchmark problems

problem in cloud computing, has gained much attention among many
researchers recently. Due to the NP-hardness of VNE, the existing
solvers are either inefficient or inaccurate. This paper develops a
novel algorithm based on the ant colony system (ACS). To solve the VNE
problem, the algorithm structure concentrates on the link mapping from
virtual network to substrate network. Particularly, for a specific
virtual network request, we first sort the embedding sequence of virtual
nodes according to their link resources. Then, ACS is used to embed the
virtual nodes onto substrate nodes according the sorted sequence, while
the virtual links are mapped via a shortest path strategy for the
embedded nodes. For the first time, we propose a link resource heuristic
information and incorporate it into the search process of ACS. The link
resource heuristic information has two significant effects, one is to
make virtual nodes tend to be embedded on the substrate nodes that cost
less bandwidth, and the other is to confirm the connectivity of the
substrate nodes that embed the virtual nodes. The proposed algorithm
improves the optimization performance of VNE when compared with a few
existing algorithms, while it substantially reduces the cost of time.},

variants existing in the literature such as CoDE, JADE, SaDE, and
ranking-based mutation operator. The primary feature of UDE lies in
unifying the main idea of CoDE, JADE, SaDE, and ranking-based mutation.
UDE uses three trial vector generation strategies and two parameter
settings. At each generation, UDE divides the current population into
two sub-populations. In the top sub-population, UDE employs all the
three trial vector generation strategies on each target vector, just
like in CoDE. For the bottom sub-population, UDE employs strategy
adaptation, in which the trial vector generation strategies are
periodically self-adapted by learning from their experiences in
generating promising solutions in the top sub-population. Further, UDE
utilizes a DE mutation strategy based local search operation. The
constraints are handled in UDE using static penalty method. In contrast
to most of the DE variants presented in the literature, UDE employs a
generational replacement strategy. The proposed UDE algorithm is tested
on the 28 benchmark problems provided for the CEC 2017 competition on
constrained real parameter optimization. The experimental results
demonstrate the efficacy of the presented algorithm in solving

advantages; in particular, the final search queries are easily

approach to appropriately handle various types of interconnected
intersections, while maintaining an efficient throughput of vehicles and
minimizing delay is tested. Results indicate that neuro-evolution is an
effective method for automating collective driving behaviors that are
robust across a broad range of road networks, where evolved controllers

goal is to build up three different voices, melodies, based on a
previously provided one, being it a soprano melody or a bass instead, so
that a complete soprano, alto, tenor and bass (SATB) score is completed.
The nature of the problem, combinatorial, has attracted interest for
decades, and different artificial intelligence techniques have
subsequently been applied, such as constraint programing or genetic
algorithms. Although researchers employing the first have already stated
that the problem is basically solved, and comparisons with GAs typically
benefit the first, we think that a critical review of literature may
provide useful information demonstrating that the problem is open for
improvement, and that GAs still have an opportunity: tests presented in
literature frequently employ examples of low difficulty, which provide
misleading conclusions. In this paper we present a review the literature
and show that the samples employed to test every available technique are
frequently oversimplified; moreover, we have analyzed many of the
solutions provided, and have seen how they are not solutions at all,
given the number of errors they embody. Yet, we not only try to show
drawbacks of previous approaches. We also try to understand difficulties
for GAs when addressing the problem. We analyze the nature of the
problem performing a number of tests, and try to see why the standard GA
cannot cope with the problem. We propose new approaches that show how
GAs could in the future be perfectly capable of addressing large and
complex samples, providing solutions of much higher quality.},

method for automatically finding relevant information for transfer
between two source domain problems from the same problem domain based on

modular transfer learning framework, being added to the function set for
a target problem prior to population initialisation. The performance of

two distinct problem domains, namely symbolic regression and Boolean
domain problems, and compared to standard GP and the-state-of-the-art

task. We can find such problems in engineering optimization, scientific

the iL-SHADE algorithm, mainly with a new weighted version of mutation
strategy. The experiments were performed on CEC 2017 benchmark
functions, which are different from previous competition benchmark
functions. A comparison of the proposed jSO algorithm and the L-SHADE
algorithm is presented first. From the obtained results we can conclude
that jSO performs better in comparison with the L-SHADE algorithm. Next,
a comparison of jSO and iL-SHADE is also performed, and jSO obtained
better or competitive results. Using the CEC 2017 evaluation method, jSO
obtained the best final score among these three algorithms.},

easily controlled properties making it ideal for this modeling task.
These subsidies are intended to encourage deal making but, if abruptly
discontinued or funded unreliably, may have different effects from those
intended. The study also demonstrates the generalization of the game to
three players, something that the set-based formalism makes easy. Agents
are encoded using a finite state representation that conditions its
transitions on the result of deals. These results fall into three
categories, the agent obtains the highest amount, the agent receives a
lesser amount, or the agents fail to make a deal. This study compares a
situation with no subsidies with dependable and undependable subsidies,
using the rate at which deals are made as a assessment statistic. Two
sorts of undependability are studied, abrupt cessation of the subsidy
and unreliable funding.},

An empirical approach to measuring the amount of neutrality would
provide a stepping stone for future studies on the effects of
neutrality. To date, there is no offline technique to achieve this in
continuous domains. This paper proposes two normalised measures of
neutrality based on a progressive random walk algorithm. Measurements
are shown to agree with visual analysis of two-dimensional benchmark
problems, and are shown to scale well to higher dimensions. The measures
are ultimately applied to neural network classification problems where
saturation-induced neutrality is confirmed.},

abstract={The large-scale integration of renewable energy sources (RESs)
at the distribution network level provides several benefits and
opportunities for the distribution network as well as the transmission
network, despite having some technical challenges such as intermittency
handling, network voltage control, etc. Such RESs are typically
accompanied with battery storage systems (BSSs) to mitigate effects of
their intermittency. The RES-BSS systems can therefore be used to
provide ancillary services to the transmission network while providing
technical benefits to the distribution network operator (DNO) and
economic benefits to the RES owners. Further, computational intelligence
based techniques can provide a near-optimal solution within fewer
iterations of the algorithm, which is a critical requirement in
fulfilling ancillary service requests. Therefore, this paper presents a
fully distributed computational intelligence based technique so that the
distribution network could handle ancillary service requests by the
transmission system operator (TSO) in real-time. Specifically, an agent

pseudo-random and true random (physical) number generators. They exploit
some properties of random numbers to quantify to what extent the
observed behavior of the tested sequence approximates the expected one.
Given the many sides of randomness, there is not an unique test
providing the whole picture, instead a suite of tests assessing
different aspects randomness. A robust test suite must include
independent tests, otherwise tests would assess the same property,
providing redundant information. This paper addresses the independence
assessment of a popular test suite named Ent. To this end we generate a
large number of pseudo-random numbers with different degrees of
randomness by evolving them with a Genetic Algorithm. The numbers are
generated to maximize their diversity attending different criteria based
on Ent output, used as fitness. We encourage diversity by maximizing and
minimizing randomness measures. Once a diverse set of pseudo-random
numbers is generated, the Ent test suite is run on them, and their
statistics studied by means of a classical correlation analysis. The
results show high correlation among some statistics used in the
literature, which could be overestimating the quality of their
randomness source.},

narrow down the set of rationalizable strategies into a set of

co-evolutionary algorithm is devised. The effectiveness of the algorithm
is studied using an academic example of a zero-sum MOG involving two

using a discrete version of the example. The results substantiate the

After training the autoencoder on 1051 different words and their

abstract={Multi-objective Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (MOEDAS)
have been successfully applied to solve Multi-objective Optimization
Problems (MOPs) since they are able to model dependencies between
variables of the problem and then sample new solutions to guide the
search to promising areas. A state-of-the-art optimizer for
single-objective continuous functions that also uses probabilistic
modeling is the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy
(CMA-ES). Different variants of CMA-ES have been proposed for MOPs
however most of them are based on Pareto dominance as the main selection
criterion. Recently, a new multi-objective CMA-ES called MOEA/D-CMA was
proposed combining the strengths of CMA-ES with those of the
multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D).
Nowadays, however, researchers on MOEAs agree that combining Pareto and
decomposition can be beneficial for the search on MOPs. As a result, a
new MOEA has been proposed, called MOEA/DD. This algorithm modifies the
MOEA/D by including a new Pareto dominance update mechanism that brings
more diversity into the search. In this study, we extend the MOEA/D-CMA
by replacing its update mechanism by the one of MOEA/DD. The hypothesis
is that this update mechanism will improve the performance of MOEA/D-CMA
as it improved MOEA/D. MOEA/D-CMA and MOEA/DD-CMA are implemented and
evaluated through an experimental study. The experimental study involves
two well-known families of benchmark problems whose objective numbers
scale from two to fifteen. Then, an extensive statistical analysis of
the results is made to extract sound, statistically supported
conclusions about the performance of the algorithms as the number of

often formulated as a multiobjective optimization problem where multiple

approaches are popular in solving that Pareto based approaches yield a
set of solutions known as Pareto front where all the solutions are
non-dominated with respect to each other. A single solution is selected
by the decision maker according to his/her preference. But when the
number of non-dominated solutions is large in number, then it is
difficult for the decision maker to choose the one solution. The
selection of a solution from the given Pareto front is known as
Post-Pareto optimality analysis. In the past many approaches were
proposed for solving the aforementioned problem, but most of these
involve the decision maker. In this paper, we have proposed an approach
to obtain a single solution from a set of non-dominated solutions by
combining these solutions without the intervention of the decision
maker. We have evaluated our approach on the set of solutions obtained
after application of a newly developed multiobjective based clustering
technique on bibliographic databases like DBLP.},

elitist behavior performed by the agents during the evolutionary

agent if it does not meet specific requirements. Further we analyze the
impact of three different methods to aggregate the objective values into
a single fitness value that is applicable for the evolutionary mechanism
of the system. The results show that heterogeneity in the optimization
behavior of the agents is very beneficial as it maintains a higher
diversity in the system. The elitist behavior of the agents slows the
evolutionary process but gives it a stronger pull towards qualitatively
higher positions in the objective space. Indeed, the pace of the
evolutionary process ultimately has a higher impact on the adaptability
of the system than the amount of redundancy in the genetic information.},

abstract={This paper presents a non-nested algorithm for the solution of
multi-objective min-max problems (MOMMP) in worst-case optimization. The
algorithm has been devised for evidence-based robust optimization, where
the lack of a defined probabilistic behaviour of the uncertain
parameters makes it impossible to apply sample-based techniques and
forces the designer to identify the worst case over the subdomains of
the uncertainty space. In evidence theory, the robustness of the
solutions is measured in terms of the Belief in the realization of the
value of the design budgets, which acts as a lower bound to the unknown
cumulative distribution function of the budget. Thus a means of finding
robust solutions in preliminary design consists on applying the minimax
model, where the worst-case budget over the uncertainty space is
optimized over the control space. The paper proposes a novel heuristic
to solve MOMMP and demonstrates its capability to approximate the
worst-case Pareto front at a very reduced cost with respect to
approaches based on nested optimization.},

on random key techniques. In this paper, after highlighting the main
criticalities of the random key approach, we introduce a totally
discrete PSO variant for permutation-based optimization problems. The
proposed algorithm, namely Algebraic PSO (APSO), simulates the original
PSO design in permutations search space. APSO directly represents the

scheme is based on a general algebraic framework for combinatorial
optimization previously, and successfully, introduced in the context of
discrete differential evolution schemes. The particularities of the PSO
design scheme arouse new challenges for the algebraic framework: the
non-commutativity of the velocity terms, and the rationale behind the
PSO inertial move. Design solutions have been proposed for both the
issues, and two APSO variants are provided. Experiments have been held
to compare the performances of the APSO schemes with respect to the
random key based PSO schemes in literature. Widely adopted benchmark

erosion. This manuscript focuses on this issue by presenting
experimental results obtained over realistic scenarios of two heuristic

robotic swarms that collaborate together to accomplish a mission. The
heuristic techniques resort to a Random-Keys encoding strategy to
represent the allocation of robots to tasks whereas the relative

abstract={Estimation of Distribution Algorithms have proved to be very
competitive for solving combinatorial and continuous optimisation
problems. However, there are problems for which they have not been
extensively developed: we refer to constrained optimisation problems.
Existing proposals approach these problems by (i) modifying the sampling
strategy of the probabilistic model to allow feasible solutions or (ii)
adopting general approaches used in the context of heuristic
optimisation such as penalisation. Nonetheless, from a theoretical point
of view, little progress have been given in the context of EDAs when
developing algorithms designed specifically to solve constrained
problems. In this paper, we propose developing EDAs by introducing
probability models defined exclusively on the space of feasible
solutions. In this sense, we give a first approach by taking the Graph
Partitioning Problem (GPP) as a case of study, and present a
probabilistic model defined exclusively on the feasible region of
solutions: a square lattice probability model. The experiments conducted
on a benchmark of 22 artificial instances confirm the effectiveness of
the proposal in terms of quality of solutions and execution time.},

abstract={Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have become a powerful, widely
used, and successful mechanism to solve problems of different nature and
varied complexity. Their ability to build models adapted to complex
non-linear problems, have made them a technique widely applied and
studied. One of the fields where this technique is currently being
applied is in the malware classification problem. The malware
classification problem has an increasing complexity, due to the growing
number of features needed to represent the behaviour of the application
as exhaustively as possible. Although other classification methods, as
those based on SVM, have been traditionally used, the DNN pose a
promising tool in this field. However, the parameters and architecture
setting of these DNNs present a serious restriction, due to the
necessary time to find the most appropriate configuration. This paper
proposes a new genetic algorithm designed to evolve the parameters, and
the architecture, of a DNN with the goal of maximising the malware
classification accuracy, and minimizing the complexity of the model.
This model is tested against a dataset of malware samples, which are
represented using a set of static features, so the DNN has been trained
to perform a static malware classification task. The experiments carried
out using this dataset show that the genetic algorithm is able to select
the parameters and the DNN architecture settings, achieving a 91%
accuracy.},

abstract={The declustering of an earthquake catalog identify the
background events (seismic events generated by regular earth movements),
which leads to an unbiased estimation of seismic activities in a region.
The ergodicity of a seismic region represents the ensemble average of
events in time and space. The ergodicity of a seismic catalog is
represented by a Thirumalai-Mountain (TM) metric. If the inverse TM
metric becomes linear with time then the catalog is assumed to be
declustered (it contains only the background events). But the original
catalog normally contains backgrounds as well as seismically triggered
events (Foreshocks and Aftershocks). The objective here is to optimally
remove the triggered events from the catalog with an optimization
algorithm so that the remaining catalog contains only the backgrounds.
Here a parallel Grey Wolf Optimization (P-GWO) is introduced to perform
the optimization task. Compared to the original GWO here the new updated
positions of wolves are computed in parallel which reduces the
computational complexity of the algorithm keeping the same accuracy
level. The analysis is carried out on Southern California catalog and
the results obtained are superior to that achieved by Cho et al. using
PSO in 2010. Comparative results also demonstrate better performance
over three benchmark statistical de-clustering methods by
Gardner-Knopoff, Uhrhammer and Reseanberg.},

the authors' previous efforts, uses a covariance matrix
adaption-evolutionary strategy approach to optimize transform parameters
of an affine transformation which includes normalization, translation,
dilation (or erosion), roll, pitch, and yaw, such that the application
of the transformation warps the measured dose distribution to the
planned dose distribution. The deviations, from unity, of the
transformation parameters associated with translations and with scaling,
and the deviations, from zero, of those associated with rotations, are a
means of assessing possible errors in experimental setup, as well as
possible errors in the dose calculation algorithm used in the treatment
planning system. The optimization selects a Pareto-optimal set of eight
transformation parameters that minimizes the difference, in the sense of
the sum of least squares, between the doses at distinct points in the
calculated and measured dose distributions. The method was tested using
four distinct treatment plans, and the results indicate that it may

differential evolution (DE/rand/1/bin) satisfies these black-box

black box differential evolution (BBDE), whose performance is invariant
under a coordinate system translation, an orthogonal rotation, a
reflection and a permutation of parameters. Performance is also
invariant under both the addition of a function bias and an
order-preserving transform of the objective function. On the family of
ellipsoids, its performance is invariant to both scaling and
high-conditioning (eccentricity). Additionally, BBDE is free of both
selection and generating drift biases. Furthermore, selection, mutation
and recombination are decoupled to become independent operations, as
they should be, since each performs a distinctly different function that
ought not to be duplicated by another. BBDE also satisfies a few
algorithm-specific, symmetry-based constraints. Like the CMA-ES, BBDE's
only control parameter is the population size. In short, BBDE appears to
be the simplest DE strategy to conform to a set of symmetry-based

abstract={The population-based ant colony optimization algorithm (P-ACO)
differs from other ACO algorithms because of its implementation of the
pheromone update. P-ACO keeps track of a population of solutions, which
serves as an archive of solutions generated by the ants' colony.
Pheromone updates in P-ACO are only done based on solutions that enter
or leave the solution archive. The population-based scheme reduces
considerably the computation time needed for the pheromone update when
compared to classical ACO algorithms such as Ant System. In this work,
we study the behavior of P-ACO when solving the traveling salesman and
the quadratic assignment problem. In particular, we investigate the
impact of a local search on P-ACO parameters and performance. The
results show that P-ACO reaches competitive performance but that the
parameter settings and algorithm behavior are strongly problem-dependent.},

Unsupervised Learning in which similar data are put into the same

is one of the state-of-the-art algorithms that address this concern. In
ACDE, the mechanism to determine the optimal number of clusters is by
encoding the activation value of each cluster centroid into the
chromosome with fixed threshold value. However, it could be argued that
a fixed threshold value would be seen as arbitrary, but a varying and
adaptive threshold value could yield a solution that would better
reflect the quality of clusters. In this paper, a new changing schema of
threshold values is introduced for adaptively activating the clusters in
the chromosomes, and a heuristic approach is implemented for adjusting
the threshold values of each cluster according to their individual
quality measurements. The results of several experiments show that the
proposed algorithm performed generally better than other

into the optimization process. It aims at finding a more fine-grained
resolution of a target region without exploring the whole set of Pareto
optimal solutions. It can guide the search towards the regions on the
Pareto Front which are of real interest to the decision maker. The
algorithm framework has been combined with SMS-EMOA, R2-EMOA, NSGA-II to
form three target region based multiobjective evolutionary algorithms:
T-SMS-EMOA, T-R2-EMOA and T-NSGA-II. In these algorithms, three ranking
criteria are applied to achieve a well-converged and well-distributed
set of Pareto optimal solutions in the target region. The three criteria
are: 1. Non-dominated sorting; 2. indicators (hypervolume or R2
indicator) or crowding distance in the new coordinate space (i.e. target
region) after coordinate transformation; 3. the Chebyshev distance to
the target region. Rectangular and spherical target regions have been
tested on some benchmark problems, including continuous problems and
discrete problems. Experimental results show that new algorithms can
handle the preference information very well and find an adequate set of
Pareto-optimal solutions in the preferred regions quickly. Moreover, the
proposed algorithms have been enhanced to support multiple target

overcome this problem, one option is to correct the orbit direction by

perturbation acting on the spacecraft, a number of parameters related to
the spacecraft and its propulsion system must be optimized. This article
lays out the trajectory optimization of orbital precession missions
using Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs). In this research, the dynamics of
spacecraft in the presence of orbital perturbation is modeled. The
optimization approach is employed based on the parametrization of the
problem according to the space mission. Numerous space mission cases
have been studied in low and middle Earth orbits, where various types of
orbital perturbations are acted on spacecraft. Consequently, several EAs
are employed to solve the optimization problem. Results demonstrate the
practicality of different EAs, along with comparing their convergence
rates. With a unique trajectory model, EAs prove to be an efficient,
reliable and versatile optimization solution, capable of being
implemented in conceptual and preliminary design of spacecraft for

abstract={For decades iris recognition has been widely studied by the
scientific community due to its almost unique and stable patterns. Iris
recognition biometric systems apply mathematical pattern-recognition
techniques to an iris' image of an individual's eye to extract its
feature vector. Comparing the dissimilarities from two feature vectors
with an acceptance threshold, the system decides if the two vectors are
from the same individual's eye. If applied in a well-controlled
environment, iris recognition can achieve outstanding accuracies,
however, to accomplish that in non-controlled environments is still a
challenge researchers are constantly trying to compensate open issues in
this context. In order to better explore the patterns found in the iris,
researchers have recently begun using a classification approach using
multiple signatures, hoping to improve the algorithm robustness. This
work aims to explore the effectiveness and scalability of using multiple
signatures with a 2-D Gabor filter in a biometric verification system
through iris recognition. This is done using two independent Genetic
Algorithms to search for the best parameters to the feature extraction
technique and on the acceptance frontier search. The method was
evaluated by analyzing the behavior of the Half Total Error Rate (HTER)
when the number of partitions varies. The experiments showed that the
best result was found with 12 partitions on the iris, reaching 0.21% of
HTER.},

modern most challenging problems from science. Simplified protein models
are usually applied to simulate and study some characteristics of the

applied in order to find simplified protein structures in which the
protein configuration has the minimal energy. However, these strategies
have difficulties in finding the optimal solutions to the longer
sequences of amino-acids, due to the complexity of the problem and the
huge amount of local optima. Hyper heuristics have proved to be useful
in this type of context since they try to combine different heuristics
strengths into a single framework. However, there is lack of work

paper proposes GEHyPSP, an approach which aims to achieve generation,
through grammatical evolution, of selection mechanisms and acceptance

systems based on Medical Imaging could support radiologists in grading
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by means of Computed Tomography (CT)
images, avoiding medical invasive procedures such as biopsies. The
identification and characterization of Regions of Interest (ROIs)
containing lesions is an important phase allowing an easier
classification in two classes of HCCs. Two steps are needed for the
detection of lesioned ROIs: a liver isolation in each CT slice and a
lesion segmentation. Materials and methods: In our previous study,
materials consisted in abdominal CT hepatic lesions of only three
patients subjected to liver transplant, partial hepatectomy, or
US-guided needle biopsy. In this paper, thanks to a more extensively
phase of data collection, available materials impressively grew to 18
patients belonging to 2-balanced classes. Several approaches were
implemented to segment the region of liver and, then, to detect the ROI
of the lesions. At the end of these preprocessing phases, we extracted
the same morphological features of the previous work and designed an
evolutionary algorithm to optimize neural network classifiers based on
different subsets of features. Results and conclusion: Tests conducted
on the new ANN topologies showed a higher generalization of the average
performance indices regardless of the applied training, validation and
test sets, confirming both the validity and the robustness of the
approach of previous study even though the limited number of patients.},

based on decomposition and aggregation methods, affecting the diversity

The basic methods, following the method proposed by Scheffé, have some
limitations mainly when the number of objectives increases, because the
number of weight vectors and hence the population size becomes very
large. In this paper, we present a new method for weight vector
generation that can create an arbitrary number of weight vectors, almost
equally spaced, located in a surface in the first orthant of the
objective space, with free choice of norm. The proposed evolutionary
algorithm is able to prevent the creation of weight vectors along the
border of the orthant, which is a region that contains solutions of
little interest to the decision maker. With a small modification in the
proposed method it is also possible to create cones of weight vectors,
useful to explore specific regions of the decision space defined by
preference directions. In our experiments, different sets of weight
vectors were generated, varying the number of vectors and the dimension
of the space. The validation of the results was given by the mean
distance of each vector to its nearest neighbor, as well as the standard
deviation and the Pearson coefficient of variation for this mean value.
The results indicate that the proposed method is able to produce a
distribution of vectors close to a uniform distribution, with no
clustering of points, being useful for guiding decomposition-based MOEA.},

experimental work considers five variants of GSGP, that incorporate
local search strategies, optimal mutations and alignment in error space.

Optimization (PPSO). PPSO leverages Fuzzy Logic to dynamically determine
the best settings for the inertia weight, cognitive factor and social
factor. The PPSO algorithm significantly differs from other versions of
PSO relying on Fuzzy Logic, because specific settings are assigned to
each particle according to its history, instead of being globally
assigned to the whole swarm. In such a way, PPSO's particles gain a
limited autonomous and proactive intelligence with respect to the
reactive agents proposed by PSO. Our results show that PPSO achieves
overall good optimization performances on the benchmark functions
proposed in the CEC 2017 test suite, with the exception of those based
on the Schwefel function, whose fitness landscape seems to mislead the
fuzzy reasoning. Moreover, with many benchmark functions, PPSO is
characterized by a higher speed of convergence than PSO in the case of
high-dimensional problems.},

abstract={Dynamic vehicle routing problem with time windows is an
important combinatorial optimisation problem in many real-world
applications. The most challenging part of the problem is to make
real-time decisions (i.e. whether to accept the newly arrived service
requests or not) during the execution of the routes. It is hardly
applicable to use the optimisation methods such as mathematical
programming and evolutionary algorithms that are competitive for static
problems, since they are usually time-consuming, and cannot give
real-time responses. In this paper, we consider solving this problem
using heuristics. A heuristic gradually builds a solution by adding the
requests to the end of the route one by one. This way, it can take
advantage of the latest information when making the next decision, and
give immediate response. In this paper, we propose a meta-algorithm to
generate a solution given any heuristic. The meta-algorithm maintains a
set of routes throughout the scheduling horizon. Whenever a new request
arrives, it tries to re-generate new routes to include the new request
by the heuristic. It accepts the new request if successful, and reject
otherwise. Then we manually designed several heuristics, and proposed a
genetic programming-based hyper-heuristic to automatically evolve
heuristics. The results showed that the heuristics evolved by genetic
programming significantly outperformed the manually designed heuristics.},

known problem of chattering, which affects Sliding Mode controllers.
Dynamic Surface Control is compared to the conventional

fields has motivated the scientific community to focus on the
development of new methods towards improving the performance of the
classifiers over this particular class of data. In this context the
related literature has extensively shown that dynamic time warping is
the similarity measure of choice when univariate time series are
considered. However, possible statistical coupling among different
dimensions make the generalization of this metric to the multivariate
case all but obvious. This has ignited the interest of the community in
new distance definitions capable of capturing such inter-dimension
dependences. In this paper we propose a simple dynamic time warping
based distance that finds the best weighted combination between the
dependent - where multivariate time series are treated as whole - and
independent approaches - where multivariate time series are just a
collection of unrelated univariate time series - of the time series to
be classified. A benchmark of four heuristic wrappers, namely, simulated
annealing, particle swarm optimization, estimation of distribution
algorithms and genetic algorithms are used to evolve the set of
weighting coefficients towards maximizing the cross-validated predictive
score of the classifiers. In this context one of the most recurring
classifiers is nearest neighbor. This classifier is couple with a
distance that as afore mentioned, in most cases, have been dynamic time
warping. The performance of the proposed approach is validated over
datasets widely utilized in the related literature, from which it is
concluded that the obtained performance gains can be enlarged by
properly decoupling the influence of each dimension in the definition of
the dependent dynamic time warping distance.},

(GA) to solve the 0-1 Multidimensional Knapsack Problem (MKP01), which
is a well-known NP-hard combinatorial optimisation problem. In
combinatorial optimisation problems, the best solutions have usually a
common partial structure. For MKP01, this structure contains the items
with a high values and low weights. The proposed algorithm called
Genetic Algorithm Guided by Pretreatment information (GAGP) calculates
these items and uses this information to guide the search process.
Therefore, GAGP is divided into two steps, in the first, a greedy
algorithm based on the efficiency of each item determines the subset of
items that are likely to appear in the best solutions. In the second,
this knowledge is utilised to guide the GA process. Strategies to
generate the initial population and calculate the fitness function of
the GA are proposed based on the pretreatment information. Also, an
operator to update the efficiency of each item is suggested. The
pretreatment information has been investigated using the CPLEX
deterministic optimiser. In addition, GAGP has been examined on the most
used MKP01 data-sets, and compared to several other approaches. The
obtained results showed that the pretreatment succeeded to extract the
most part of the important information. It has been shown, that GAGP is
a simple but very competitive solution.},

abstract={Software architects devote substantial efforts to find the
most fitting architectural description for their system, which should
not only specify its structure, but is also required to meet multiple,
simultaneous quality criteria. Evolutionary computation has recently
demonstrated to provide insightful support during the design phase by
automatically deciding how to organise internal software components and
how they should interact each other. Observed from a multi-objective
perspective, particular care has to be taken in order to reach an
appropriate trade-off among design metrics, while providing the software
engineer with diverse alternatives to choose among. However,
multi-objective evolutionary algorithms may find difficulties to control
both aspects and, at the same time, to explore the entire search space
in depth. Under these circumstances, local search can be applied to
complement the evolution by scrutinising the most promising search
directions. This paper proposes two different approaches that take
advantage of the benefits of local search within the multi-objective
evolutionary discovery of component-based software architectures. A
detailed analysis and comparative study provides interesting findings
like the importance of assigning a sufficient number of evaluations to
the local improvement. The way in which local search explores and
compares solutions for acceptance is a relevant aspect to promote
diversity during the discovery process as well.},

Existing solutions typically follow a divide-and-conquer approach in
which the data is split into several chunks that are addressed
individually. Next, the partial knowledge acquired from every slice of
data is aggregated in multiple ways to solve the entire problem.
However, these approaches are missing a global view of the data as a
whole, which may result in less accurate models. In this work we carry
out a first attempt on the design of a global evolutionary undersampling
model for imbalanced classification problems. These are characterised by
having a highly skewed distribution of classes in which evolutionary
models are being used to balance the dataset by selecting only the most
relevant data. Using Apache Spark as big data technology, we have
introduced a number of variations to the well-known CHC algorithm to
work with very large chromosomes and reduce the costs associated to the
fitness evaluation. We discuss some preliminary results, showing the

a multi-objective mathematical formulation for the CRDP that minimizes
the calorie count of the diet and maximizes the number of proteins

optimization procedure by alternating the adaptation of the

optimization process we extract information which we exploit in the next

exploit this information and is robust to erroneous initial information.

the time series of 3D coordinates of cooperative aircraft flights, the
corresponding target detection recordings from multiple radars, and the

learning such rules from radar performance measures that explain tracker
performance. The easily interpretable rules are intended to reveal the
real behavior of the system providing comprehension for its control and
further development. The learned rules allow predicting tracker
performance level for the system control in all radar geometries, modes,

abstract={In recent years, several memetic algorithms with explicit
mechanisms to delay convergence have shown great promise when solving
9×9 Sudoku puzzles. This paper analyzes and extends state-of-the-art
schemes for dealing with Sudoku puzzles of larger dimensionality. Two
interesting aspects are analyzed: the importance of the encoding and its
relation with the way of managing the diversity. Specifically, three
different ways of encoding the individuals and six different methods,
including four that control the diversity in a special way, are studied.
Computational results are shown with twenty 16×16 Sudoku puzzles.
Contrary to the low-dimensional case, important differences appear among
the several ways of controlling diversity. Specifically, a method that
incorporates multi-objective concepts in the replacement phase to deal
with the diversity, resulted in the most promising method. Results show
that both the encoding and the way of managing diversity are crucial to
attain high success probabilities in large Sudoku puzzles. They also
show that, while the analyzed encodings induce different search space
sizes, this feature is not enough to justify the differences in the
performance attained by them.},

the Bi-Firefighter Problem (FFP2), where the second element (water) is
introduced. FFP2 corresponds to the practical optimization problems,
where more than one disease is spreading in the environment, and the
objective is to minimize the total loss. Since the loss may come from
two different sources, each of which causes different damages, the
objective function is more complex than in the case of the original FFP.
In this paper, an evolutionary approach to FFP2, the EA-FFP2 algorithm,
based on a multi-modal Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA), is
proposed. EA-FFP2 was validated on a number of benchmark FFP2 instances
that were also solved by the branch and bound algorithms or the
heuristic local search algorithms run for a large number of iterations
for a long time. Computational experiments confirmed that EA-FFP2 was
capable of solving FFP2 and finding solutions close to the optima
determined by the branch and bound algorithms or to the quasi-optima
determined by exhaustive local search.},

been theoretically analysed on different monotonic functions, and it was
shown that EA+RL can exclude harmful auxiliary objectives from
consideration. EA+RL has also shown good results on different real-world
problems. However, it has not been theoretically analysed whether this
method can efficiently optimize non-monotonic functions using simple
evolutionary algorithms and reinforcement learning agents. In this paper
we consider optimization of the non-monotonic JUMP function with the
EA+RL method. We use two auxiliary objectives. One of them is helpful
during the first phase of optimization and another one is helpful during
the last phase. On other stages they are constant, so they neither help
nor slow optimization down. We show that EA+RL has at least Ω(ℓ/n)
probability of solving this problem in polynomial time using random
local search, which is impossible for the conventional random local
search without learning. We also propose a modification of EA+RL that is

utilized in the same optimization run to repair variables to achieve a
faster convergence to the Pareto-optimal set. Different principles
learned during an optimization run can not only have different number of
variables but, may also have variables that are common among a number of
principles. Moreover, a preference order for repairing variables may
play an important role for proper convergence. Thus, when multiple
principles exist, it is important to use a strategy that is most
beneficial for repairing evolving population of solutions. This paper
makes a first attempt to assess and understand the effect of different
strategies to make innovization-based repair of variables most useful.

abstract={Physical activity is widely known to be a key factor towards
achieving a healthy life and reducing the chance of developing certain
diseases. However, there are many different physical activities having
different effort requirements or having different benefits on health.
The reason why automatic recognition of physical activity is useful is
twofold: first, it raises personal awareness about the physical activity
a user is carrying out and its impact on health, allowing some apps to
give proper credit for it; second, it allows medical staff to monitor
the activity levels of patients. In this paper, we follow a proven
activity recognition chain to learn a classifier for physical activity
recognition, which is trained using data from PAMAP2, a dataset publicly
available in UCI ML repository. Once a machine learning dataset is
created after signal preprocessing, segmentation and feature extraction,
we will explore and compare different feature selection techniques using
genetic algorithms in order to maximize the accuracy and reduce the
number of dimensions. This reduction improves classification times and
reduces costs and energy consumption of sensor devices. By doing so, we
have reduced dimensions to almost a half and we have outperformed the
best results found so far in literature with an average accuracy of
97.45%.},

General Video Game AI agents, since they can be deployed directly on a
new game without game-specific tuning; these agents tend to be based on
stochastic algorithms which give robust but noisy results and tend to be
expensive to run. This motivates the main contribution of the paper: the
development of the novel N-Tuple Bandit Evolutionary Algorithm, where a
model is used to estimate the fitness of unsampled points and a bandit
approach is used to balance exploration and exploitation of the search
space. Initial results on optimising a Space Battle game variant suggest
that the algorithm offers far more robust results than the Random
Mutation Hill Climber and a Biased Mutation variant, which are
themselves known to offer competitive performance across a range of
problems. Subjective observations are also given by human players on the
nature of the evolved games, which indicate a preference towards games

abstract={In recent years, research interests have been paid in solving
real-world optimization problems with variable-length representation.
For population-based optimization algorithms, the challenge lies in
maintaining diversity in sizes of solutions and in designing a suitable
recombination operator for achieving an adequate diversity. In dealing
with multiple conflicting objectives associated with a variable-length
problem, the resulting multiple trade-off Pareto-optimal solutions may
inherently have different variable sizes. In such a scenario, the fixed
recombination and mutation operators may not be able to maintain
large-sized solutions, thereby not finding the entire Pareto-optimal
set. In this paper, we first construct multiobjective test problems with
variable-length structures, and then analyze the difficulties of the
constructed test problems by comparing the performance of three
state-of-the-art multiobjective evolutionary algorithms. Our preliminary
experimental results show that MOEA/D-M2M shows good potential in
solving the multiobjective test problems with variable-length structures
due to its diversity strategy along different search directions. Our
correlation analysis on the Pareto solutions with variable sizes in the
Pareto front indicates that mating restriction is necessary in solving
variable-length problem.},

between the classes unless the dataset has been transformed by some
mapping function so that the decision boundary becomes linear or it is a
good approximation to a linear boundary. Often these mapping functions
may result in a dataset with very large dimension or even infinite
dimension. To avoid the curse of dimensionality, kernel functions are
used as mapping functions. However, a kernel SVM has quadratic time
complexity, and hence does not scale very well with large datasets.
Moreover, the choice of a kernel function and its parameter optimization
are arduous tasks. Therefore, a replacement of kernel function with an
explicit mapping function is desirable in the case of large datasets. In
this paper, we propose a novel co-evolutionary approach to find an
explicit mapping function. We use GA to evolve an n-tuple of GP trees as
a mapping function, and GP to evolve each individual GP tree. The
dataset is then transformed using the found mapping function so that a
linear SVM can be used. Besides the fact that the proposed algorithm
allows us to use a fast linear SVM, the results also show that the
proposed algorithm outperforms the kernel trick and even performs as
good as the kernel trick combined with feature selection.},

(DE) for 3D UAV path planning. The path-planning problem is formulated
as a multi-objective unconstrained optimization problem in the aim of
minimizing the fuel and the threat cost as well as finding the shortest
path. A fuzzy logic controller is used to find the parameter values of
DE during this optimization process. The mutation operation of DE is
modified in a way to strike a balance between the DE/rand/1 and
DE/best/1 strategies. This method is compared with both DE/rand/1 and
DE/best/1 and it relatively outperformed both the classical variations.
As it is often tedious to find the right parameter values for DE, this
method will give freedom from the process of finding the parameter
values for the acceptable performance in 3D path planning optimization.},

abstract={Evolutionary multitasking is an emergent topic in evolutionary
computation area. Recently, a well-known evolutionary multitasking
method, the multi-factorial evolutionary algorithm (MFEA), has been
proposed and applied to concurrently solve two or three problems. In
MFEA, individuals of different tasks are recombined in a predefined
random mating probability. As the number of tasks increases, such
recombination of different tasks becomes very frequent, thereby
detracting the search from any specific problems and limiting the MFEA's
capability to solve many-tasking problems. This study proposes a general
framework, called the evolution of biocoenosis through symbiosis (EBS),
for evolutionary algorithms to deal with the many-tasking problems. The
EBS has two main features: the selection of candidates from concatenate
offspring and the adaptive control of information exchange among tasks.
The concatenate offspring represent a set of offspring used for all
tasks. Moreover, this study presents a test suite of many-tasking
problems (MaTPs), modified from the CEC 2014 benchmark problems. The
Spearman correlation is adopted to analyze the effect of the shifts of
optima on the MaTPs. Experimental results show that the effectiveness of
EBS is superior to that of single task optimization and MFEA on the four
MaTPs. The results also validate that EBS is capable of exploiting the
synergy of fitness landscapes.},

competitive continuous optimizer. In this paper, we extend L-SHADE
towards handling mixed variable optimization problems, where some of the

handling the discrete variables, we consider three different options.
The first is to adapt the mechanism for handling categorical variables
introduced in an earlier proposed ant colony optimization algorithm,
called ACO_MV to use it with L-SHADE (L-SHADE_MV ). The second is to
apply a simpler scheme that relies on the mechanisms how ant colony
optimization algorithms traditionally tackle discrete problems
(L-SHADE_ACO ). The third is to introduce a mechanism that exploits the
ideas of DE within the generation of new values for the categorical
variables, by introducing specific rules to be applied in the mutation
(L-SHADE_RULE ). We use an automatic algorithm configuration tool for
optimizing the algorithms' parameters to allow an unbiased comparison of
the three schemes. The performance of the proposed algorithms was
evaluated on artificial mixed-variable optimization problems and
compared with L-SHADE that incorporates a simple rounding scheme to
handle categorical variables, which is used as a baseline method. The
experimental results show that all three categorical handling methods
outperform the baseline and L-SHADE_ACO is the best performing scheme in

find the parameter settings that induce the best games. One of the
hardest parts of this approach is defining a suitable fitness function.
In this paper we explore the possibility of using one of a growing set
of General Video Game AI agents to perform automatic play-testing. This
enables a very general approach to game evaluation based on estimating
the skill-depth of a game. Agent-based play-testing is computationally
expensive, so we compare two simple but efficient optimisation
algorithms: the Random Mutation Hill-Climber and the Multi-Armed Bandit
Random Mutation Hill-Climber. For the test game we use a space-battle
game in order to provide a suitable balance between simulation speed and
potential skill-depth. Results show that both algorithms are able to
rapidly evolve game versions with significant skill-depth, but that
choosing a suitable resampling number is essential in order to combat
the effects of noise.},

in the recent years since many of real-world optimization problems have
multiple/many optima and decision makers prefer to find all of them.
Multiple global/local peaks create difficulties for optimization
algorithms. In this context, niching is well-known and widely used
technique for finding multiple solutions in multi-modal optimization.
One commonly used niching technique in evolutionary algorithms is the
Clearing method. However, canonical clearing scheme reduces the
exploration capacity of the evolutionary algorithms. In this paper,
Delaunay Triangulation based Clearing (DT-Clearing) procedure is
proposed to handle multi-modal optimizations more efficiently while
preserving simplicity of canonical clearing approach. In DT-Clearing,
cleared individuals are reallocated in the biggest empty spaces formed
within the search space which are determined through Delaunay
Triangulation. The reallocation of cleared individuals discourages
wasting of the resources and allows better exploration of the landscape.
The algorithm also uses an external memory, an archive of the explored
niches, thus preventing the redundant visiting of the individuals,
henceforth finding more solutions in lesser number of generations. The
method is tested using multi-modal benchmark problems proposed for the
IEEE CEC 2013, Special Session on Niching Methods for Multimodal
Optimization. Our method obtains promising results in comparison with
the canonical clearing and demonstrates to be a competitive niching

Finally, we evaluate the implemented algorithm with the optimized

abstract={Random Key (RK) is an alternative representation for
permutation problems that enables application of techniques generally
used for continuous optimisation. Although the benefit of RKs to
permutation optimisation has been shown, its use within Estimation of
Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) has been a challenge. Recent research
proposing a RK-based EDA (RK-EDA) has shown that RKs can produce
competitive results with state of the art algorithms. Following
promising results on the Permutation Flowshop Scheduling Problem, this
paper presents an analysis of RK-EDA for optimising the total flow time.
Experiments show that RK-EDA outperforms other permutation-based EDAs on
instances of large dimensions. The difference in performance between
RK-EDA and the state of the art algorithms also decreases when the
problem difficulty increases.},

abstract={In the last three decades there have been a number of
efficient multi-objective optimization algorithms capable of solving
real-world problems. However, due to the complexity of most real-world
problems (high-dimensionality of problems, computationally expensive,
and unknown function properties) researchers and decision-makers are
increasingly facing the challenge of selecting an optimization algorithm
capable of solving their hard problems. In this paper, we propose a
simple yet efficient hybridization of multi- and many-objective
optimization algorithms framework called hybrid many-objective
optimization algorithm using fusion of solutions obtained by several
many-objective algorithms (fusion) to gain the combined benefits of
several algorithms and reducing the challenge of choosing one
optimization algorithm to solve complex problems. During the
optimization process, the Fusion framework (1) executes all optimization
algorithms in parallel, (2) it combines solutions of these algorithms
and extracts well-distributed solutions using predefined structured
reference points or user-defined reference points, and (3) adaptively
selects best-performing algorithm to tackle the problem at different
stages of the search process. A case study of the fusion framework by
considering GDE3, SMPSO, and SPEA2 as multi-objective optimization
algorithms is presented. Experimental results on five unconstrained and
four constrained benchmark test problems with three to ten objectives
show that the Fusion framework significantly outperforms all algorithms
involved in the hybridization process as well as the NSGA-III algorithm
in terms of diversity and convergence of obtained solutions.
Furthermore, the proposed framework is consistently able to find
accurate solutions for all test problems which can be interpreted as its
high robustness characteristic.},

evolutionary multitasking is capable of improving the performance of
evolutionary algorithms on exploration as well as exploitation.
Multifactorial evolutionary algorithm (MFEA) presented an effectual
implementation of evolutionary multitasking, which simultaneously seeks
the solutions to multiple optimization problems by unifying their search
spaces. The MFEA enables information sharing across tasks during
evolution. This mechanism can improve the evolutionary efficiency in the
early phase; however, it will impair the exploitation and consume extra
resources later on, due to the essential difference among the fitness
landscapes of optimization problems. This study proposes detecting the
occurrence of parting ways, at which the information sharing begins to
fail. In addition, we develop the resource allocation mechanism to
reallocate the fitness evaluations on different types of offspring by
ceasing information sharing when parting ways. Experiments are conducted
to evaluate the proposed methods. The experimental results show that
applying parting ways detection and resource reallocation for MFEA can
achieve better solution quality in most of testing cases, especially
when the tasks share low similarity of landscapes.},

attractive for incorporating in many future cryptographic applications

this paper, we use a genetic algorithm to address this vulnerability by
evolving combinational logic circuits that correctly implement elliptic

power analysis attacks. Using a fitness function composed of multiple
objectives - maximizing correctness, minimizing propagation delays and
minimizing circuit size, we can generate correct combinational logic
circuits resistant to non-invasive, side channel attacks. To the best of

abstract={The Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (DVRPTW)
is an extension of the well-known Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), which
takes into account the dynamic nature of the problem. This aspect
requires the vehicle routes to be updated in an ongoing manner as new
customer requests arrive in the system and must be incorporated into an
evolving schedule during the working day. Besides the vehicle capacity
constraint involved in the classical VRP, DVRPTW considers in addition
time windows, which are able to better capture real-world situations.
Despite this, so far, few studies have focused on tackling this problem
of greater practical importance. To this end, this study devises for the
resolution of DVRPTW, an ant colony optimization based algorithm, which
resorts to a joint solution construction mechanism, able to construct in
parallel the vehicle routes. This method is coupled with a local search
procedure, aimed to further improve the solutions built by ants, and
with an insertion heuristic, which tries to reduce the number of
vehicles used to service the available customers. The experiments
indicate that the proposed algorithm is competitive and effective, and
on DVRPTW instances with a higher dynamicity level, it is able to yield
better results compared to existing ant-based approaches.},

optimisation problems. However, the effectiveness of local search
methods will often depend strongly on the details of the heuristics used

ones is in itself a challenging search problem. A natural method to
search for effective heuristics is to represent the heuristic as a small
program and then apply evolutionary methods, such as genetic
programming. However, the search within the space of heuristics is not
well understood, and in particular little is known of the associated
search landscapes. In this paper, we consider the domain of
propositional satisfiability (SAT), and a generic class of local search
methods called `WalkSAT'. We give a language for generating the
heuristics; using this we generated over three million heuristics, in a
systematic manner, and evaluated their associated fitness values. We
then use this data set as the basis for an initial analysis of the
landscape of the space of heuristics. We give evidence that the
heuristic landscape exhibits clustering. We also consider local search
on the space of heuristics and show that it can perform quite well, and
could complement genetic programming methods on that space.},

Dual Particle Swarm Optimization (TAD-PSO), is comprised of two
specialized populations, with one focusing on exploration of the search
space and the other on exploitation. The main population, specialized in
exploration, uses orthogonal learning to create information-rich
exemplars which intelligently guide particle movement throughout the
search space. The auxiliary population uses a PSO variant known for its
very fast convergence speed, and thus very high performance on unimodal
problems. This population is specialized in exploitation of the
interesting local minima. The main population size decays linearly, to
foster exploration early and convergence in the later stages of the
optimization procedure. Additionally, TAD-PSO does not have the
topological structure of the swarm as an algorithm hyper-parameter,
making it a fast and simple algorithm to apply to new problems. TAD-PSO
was tested extensively and compared to 6 widely used PSO variants on 19
benchmark problems, for 10, 30 and 100 dimensions. TAD-PSO consistently
ranked first in each dimensional space, making it a competitive
optimization algorithm on both unimodal and multimodal problems.},

Understanding how it survives is important for the design of preventive

related organisms are capable of bioremediation. We hypothesize that P.
aeruginosa is capable of long-term survival due to the presence of
particular genes which encode for persistence proteins. In this paper,
our primary goal is to identify genes responsible for the bacterium's
survival. To achieve this, we devised a Bayesian Machine Learning based
methodology to analyze the gene expression response to low nutrient
water. This approach permitted to learn and construct from gene
expression data, an optimal probabilistic graphical model of the
survival mechanism. We then used node force techniques to infer a dozen
of genes as top orchestrators of the organism's survival mechanism in

Sequence Based Crossover (SBSBX), is introduced and compared with a
widely used operator, the Sequence-based Crossover (SBX). One of the
principles behind the design of SBSBX is to reduce the disruptive
behavior of SBX, with the aim of providing additional intensification.
Initial studies show that the different crossover operators heavily
impact the preservation of diversity in the population. Thus, two
different parent-selection operators that induce different selection
pressure are applied: random selection and binary tournament. The
proposal is validated using the well-known Solomon's benchmark. The
experimental validation shows that in some of the tested methods
premature convergence is an important issue, whereas in other cases
convergence is not attained. Overall, the combination of SBSBX and

DE framework is coupled with three new algorithmic components. Each
individual is subjected to one of the two well known mutation strategies

stage, binomial and blending crossovers are opted in the same switchable
strategy as done for mutation. A novel threshold-based selection
mechanism is used to allow less fit offspring to survive occasionally,
thus countering the noisy function behavior. Additive Gaussian noise is
used to simulate the noisy behavior of functions defined over continuous
search spaces. A benchmark suite comprising of 21 well-known numerical
functions is considered to compare and contrast the proposed method with
other state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms specifically tailored for
noisy optimization scenario. The proposed method shows very competitive

stochastic fractal search (SFS) in biogeography-based optimization

algorithm to find global optimum much faster and efficiently. The
diffusion process of SFS improved the exploitation ability of search in
BBO. Our proposed algorithm is applied on all three versions of VMI

Traditional approaches define a set of features for characterizing a

may vary nonlinearly as the solver progresses, requiring higher
resolution in specific areas of the feature domain. This work focuses on
assessing the advantage of using feature transformations to improve the
given resolution and, as a consequence, to improve the overall
performance of a hyper-heuristic. We provide evidence that using feature
transformations may result in a better discrimination of the problem
instance and, as consequence, a better performance of the
hyper-heuristics. The feature transformation strategy was applied to an
evolutionary-based hyper-heuristic model taken from the literature and
tested on constraint satisfaction problems The proposed strategy
increased the median success rate of hyper-heuristics by more than 13%

abstract={Nowadays, heuristics represent a commonly used alternative to
solve complex optimization problems. This, however, has given rise to
the problem of choosing the most effective heuristic for a given
problem. In recent years, one of the most used strategies for this task
has been the hyper-heuristics, which aim at selecting/generating
heuristics to solve a wide range of optimization problems. Most of the
existing selection hyper-heuristics attempt to recommend only one
heuristic for a given instance. However, for some classes of problems,
more than one heuristic can be suitable. With this premise, in this
paper, we address this issue through an evolutionary multilabel learning
approach for building hyper-heuristics. Unlike traditional approaches,
in the multilabel formulation, the result could not be a single
recommendation, but a set of potential heuristics. Due to the fact that
cooperative coevolutionary algorithms allow us to divide the problem
into several subproblems, it results in a natural approach for dealing
with multilabel classification. The proposed cooperative
coevolutionarymultilabel approach aims at choosing the most relevant
patterns for each heuristic. For the experimental study included in this
paper, we have used a set of constraint satisfaction problems as our
study case. Our experimental results suggest that the proposed method is
able to generate accurate hyper-heuristics that outperform reference
methods.},

abstract={Hyper-heuristics have emerged as an important strategy for
combining the strengths of different heuristics into a single method.
Although hyper-heuristics have been found to be successful in many
scenarios, little attention has been paid to the subsets of heuristics
that these methods manage and apply. In several cases, heuristics can
interfere with each other and can be harmful for the search. Thus,
obtaining information about the differences among heuristics, and how
they contribute to the search process is very important. The main
contribution of this paper is an automatic heuristic-filtering process
that allows hyper-heuristics to exclude heuristics that do not
contribute to improving the solution. Based on some previous works in
feature selection, two methods are proposed that rank heuristics and
sequentially select only suitable heuristics in a hyper-heuristic
framework. Our experiments over a set of Constraint Satisfaction Problem
instances show that a hyper-heuristic with only selected heuristics
obtains significantly better results than a hyper-heuristic containing
all heuristics, in terms of running times. In addition, the success rate
of solving such instances is better for the hyper-heuristic with the
suitable heuristics than for the hyper-heuristic without our proposed
filtering process.},

addition, in order to maintain diversity and reduce the number of the
evaluations, a migration operator is used to enhance their behavior.
This article presents a basic study on the speed-up of parallel GAs
where a common approach is followed to better understand synchronous and
asynchronous versions together. We analyze the behavior of GAs over a
homogeneous multiprocessor system. We will report results showing linear
and even superlinear speed-up in both cases of study. The parallel
performance of the synchronous and asynchronous versions is very good in
a multiprocessor computer, both in terms of time and solution quality.
Besides, a statistical analysis of the algorithms clearly proves that
both cases have a similar numerical behavior over a homogeneous parallel
system.},

abstract={In recent years, the design of new selection mechanisms based
on quality indicators has become a popular trend in the development of
Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs). This trend has been
motivated by the well-known limitations of Pareto-based MOEAs when
dealing with many-objective optimization problems (i.e., problems having
more than 3 objectives). In this paper, we propose a selection mechanism
(called IGD^+ -H) which is based on the combination of the Inverted
Generational Distance^+ (IGD^+ ) indicator and Kuhn-Munkres' (Hungarian)
algorithm to solve Linear Assignment Problems (LAPs). The proposed
selection scheme is compared with respect to other selection mechanisms
based on the IGD indicator and with respect to the use of the Δ_p
indicator. Our proposed technique is incorporated into a MOEA and is
validated using standard test functions. Our comparative study indicates
that both Δ_p and IGD present some limitations when selecting solutions
in degenerate multi-objective problems. Our results show that the
transformation of the selection mechanism into a linear assignment
problem speeds up the convergence of the MOEA and it is able to solve
many-objective problems in an effective and efficient manner. We show
that our proposed IGD^+ -H-based selection mechanism is able to achieve
a significant speed up (of up to 200×) with respect to the exclusive use
of any of the indicators adopted in our study.},

be effective at solving real-world problems. The two main categories of
hyper-heuristics are selection and generation. Selection
hyper-heuristics select existing low-level heuristics while generation
hyper-heuristics create new heuristics. At the inception of the field
single point searches were essentially employed by selection
hyper-heuristics, however as the field progressed evolutionary
algorithms are becoming more prominent. Evolutionary algorithms, namely,
genetic programming, have chiefly been used for generation
hyper-heuristics. Implementing evolutionary algorithm hyper-heuristics
can be quite a time-consuming task which is daunting for first time
researchers and practitioners who want to rather focus on the
application domain the hyper-heuristic will be applied to which can be
quite complex. This paper presents a Java toolkit for the implementation
of evolutionary algorithm hyper-heuristics, namely, EvoHyp. EvoHyp
includes libraries for a genetic algorithm selection hyper-heuristic
(GenAlg), a genetic programming generation hyper-heuristic (GenProg), a
distributed version of GenAlg (DistrGenAlg) and a distributed version of
GenProg (DistrGenProg). The paper describes the libraries and
